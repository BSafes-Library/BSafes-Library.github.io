Microsoft Fended Off a Record 2.4 Tbps DDoS Attack Targeting Azure Customers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/microsoft-fended-off-record-24-tbps.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Monday revealed that its Azure cloud platform mitigated a 2.4 Tbps distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in the last week of August targeting an unnamed customer in Europe, surpassing a&nbsp; 2.3 Tbps attack &nbsp;stopped by Amazon Web Services in February 2020.  "This is 140 percent higher than&nbsp; 2020's 1 Tbps attack &nbsp;and higher than any network volumetric event previously detected on Azure," Amir Dahan, senior program manager for Azure Networking,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post, calling it a " UDP reflection " lasting for about 10 minutes.   Reflected amplification attacks are a type of denial of service attacks wherein a threat actor takes advantage of the connectionless nature of UDP protocol with spoofed requests so as to overwhelm a target server or network with a flood of packets, causing disruption or rendering the server and its surrounding infrastructure unavailable.   The attack is said to have originated from a botnet of approximately 70,000 compromised d

Cloudflare mitigated one of the largest DDoS attack involving 17.2 million rps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/cloudflare-mitigated-one-of-largest.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web infrastructure and website security company Cloudflare on Thursday disclosed that it mitigated the largest ever volumetric distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack recorded to date.  The attack, launched via a Mirai botnet, is said to have targeted an unnamed customer in the financial industry last month. "Within seconds, the botnet bombarded the Cloudflare edge with over 330 million attack requests," the company&nbsp; noted , at one point reaching a record high of 17.2 million requests-per-second (rps), making it three times bigger than previously reported HTTP DDoS attacks.   Volumetric DDoS attacks are designed to target a specific network with an intention to overwhelm its bandwidth capacity and often utilize&nbsp; reflective amplification techniques &nbsp;to scale their attack and cause as much operational disruption as possible.  They also typically originate from a network of malware-infected systems — consisting of computers, servers, and IoT devices — enabling threat actors

Weaknesses in the implementation of TCP protocol in&nbsp; middleboxes &nbsp;and censorship infrastructure could be weaponized as a vector to stage reflected denial of service (DoS) amplification attacks, surpassing many of the existing UDP-based amplification factors to date.  Detailed by a group of academics from the University of Maryland and the University of Colorado Boulder at the USENIX Security Symposium, the volumetric attacks take advantage of TCP-non-compliance in-network middleboxes — such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and deep packet inspection (DPI) boxes — to amplify network traffic, with hundreds of thousands of IP addresses offering&nbsp; amplification factors &nbsp;exceeding those from DNS, NTP, and Memcached.   Reflected amplification attacks are a type of DoS attacks in which an adversary leverages the connectionless nature of UDP protocol with spoofed requests to misconfigured open servers in order to overwhelm a target server or network with a flood of packets, causing

A new distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) vector has ensnared Plex Media Server systems to amplify malicious traffic against targets to take them offline.  "Plex's startup processes unintentionally expose a Plex UPnP-enabled service registration responder to the general Internet, where it can be abused to generate reflection/amplification DDoS attacks," Netscout researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday alert.  Plex Media Server &nbsp;is a personal media library and streaming system that runs on modern Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems, as well as variants customized for special-purpose platforms such as network-attached storage (NAS) devices and digital media players. The desktop application organizes video, audio, and photos from a user's library and from online services, allowing access to and stream the contents to other compatible devices.   DDoS attacks typically involve flooding a legitimate target with junk network traffic that comes from a large number o

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A nascent malware campaign has been spotted co-opting Android devices into a botnet with the primary purpose of carrying out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  Called " Matryosh " by Qihoo 360's Netlab researchers, the latest threat has been found reusing the Mirai botnet framework and propagates through exposed Android Debug Bridge (ADB) interfaces to infect Android devices and ensnare them into its network.  ADB is a&nbsp; command-line tool &nbsp;part of the Android SDK that handles communications and allows developers to install and debug apps on Android devices.  While this option is turned off by default on most Android smartphones and tablets, some vendors ship with this feature enabled, thus allowing unauthenticated attackers to connect remotely via the 5555 TCP port and open the devices directly to exploitation.   This is not the first time a botnet has taken advantage of ADB to infect vulnerable devices.  In July 2018, open ADB ports were used to spread multip
