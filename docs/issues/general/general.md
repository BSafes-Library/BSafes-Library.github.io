But experts say the simplicity of that concept is both its strength and its weakness.

Password security has long been an issue for businesses and their cybersecurity standards. Account passwords are often the weakest link in the overall security posture for many organizations.  Many companies have used Microsoft's default password policies for decades. While these can be customized, businesses often accept the default values for their organization.  The Windows default password policy is a good start, but are there security vulnerabilities associated with it? Let's look at the current recommendations from leading cybersecurity authorities and see how they measure up against the Windows default password policy.  Windows default password policy settings  Many, if not most, business environments today use Microsoft Active Directory as their identity and access management solution in the enterprise.

Let's first take a look back at 2020!  Adding to the list of difficulties that surfaced last year, 2020 was also grim for personal data protection, as it has marked a new record number of leaked credentials and PI data.  A whopping 20 billion records were stolen in a single year, increasing 66% from 12 billion in 2019.

This trend seems to fit an exponential curve; even worse, we are yet to see the fallouts from the end of the year "Solorigate" campaign, which has the potential to marginalize even these numbers by the end of 2021.  Found among the leaked data are usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, healthcare information, and other personal data.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In the era of hacking and malicious actors, a company's cloud security posture is a concern that preoccupies most, if not all, organizations.  Yet even more than that, it is the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) that is critical to today's company security. Recently Malwarebytes released a statement on how they were targeted by Nation-State Actors implicated in SolarWinds breach. Their investigation suggested abuse of privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure environments.  Often left unsecured, it's SaaS setting errors like misconfigurations, inadequate legacy protocols, insufficient identity checks, credential access, and key management that leave companies open to account hijacking, insider threats, and other types of leaks or breaches in the organization.&nbsp;  Gartner has defined &nbsp;the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) category in 2020's Gartner Hype Cycle for Cloud Security as solutions that continuously assess the security risk and manage SaaS a

Phishing and Malware  Among the major cyber threats, the malware remains a significant danger. The 2017 WannaCry outbreak that cost businesses worldwide up to $4 billion is still in recent memory, and other new strains of malware are discovered on a daily basis.  Phishing has also seen a resurgence in the last few years, with many new scams being invented to take advantage of unsuspecting companies. Just one variation, the CEO Fraud email scam, cost UK businesses alone £14.8m in 2018.  Working From Home  Staff working from home are outside the direct oversight of IT support teams and often struggle to deal with cyber threats and appropriately protect company information.  Failing to update software and operating systems, sending data over insecure networks, and increasing reliance on email and online messaging has made employees far more susceptible to threats ranging from malware to phishing.  Human Error  While technical solutions like spam filters and mobile device management syste

Guide: How Security Consolidation Helps Small Cybersecurity Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/guide-how-security-consolidation-helps.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The dynamic nature of cybersecurity, the changes in the threat landscape, and the expansion of the attack surface lead organizations to add more security solutions—from different vendors—creating a layered security infrastructure that introduces new challenges to any team, with a much more significant impact on small ones.  And yet, sophisticated attacks continue to bypass these advanced security layers while FOMO (fear of missing out) compels security teams to evaluate every new solution that comes out.  A new guide, "How Security Consolidation Helps Small Security Teams" ( download here ), reviews the challenges of a layered, multi-vendor security approach for protecting your internal environment and reveals why the concept of consolidation of security solutions is becoming the go-to security approach of many CISOs with small teams.  Having a single consolidated solution for protecting your internal environment can free up much of your small team's time and reduce your

Security Operations is a 24 x 7 job. It does not stop for weekends or holidays or even that much-needed coffee break after the first hour of the shift is complete. We all know this.  Every SOC engineer is hoping for some rest at some point. One of my favorite jokes when talking about Security Operations is "3 SOC engineers walked into a bar…" That the joke. No SOC engineers have time to do that. They get it. They laugh. So why is this all true?  Let us explore that a little bit.   Demand for experienced SOC engineers far surpasses the available talent.  Event volume levels boggle the imagination compared to even just a few years ago.  Utilization of tools to their utmost capability has often not been a priority.&nbsp;   In the Security Operations space, we have been using SIEM's for many years with varying degrees of deployments, customization, and effectiveness. For the most part, they have been a helpful tool for Security Operations. But they can be better. Like any tool, t

New CISOs Survey Reveals How Small Cybersecurity Teams Can Confront 2021<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/new-cisos-survey-reveals-how-small.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The pressure on small to medium-sized enterprises to protect their organizations against cyberthreats is astronomical. These businesses face the same threats as the largest enterprises, experience the same (relative) damages and consequences when breaches occur as the largest enterprises but are forced to protect their organizations with a fraction of the resources as the largest enterprises.&nbsp;  Cybersecurity company Cynet just released findings from a survey of 200 CISOs in charge of small security teams ( Download here ) to shine "a spotlight into the challenges of small security teams everywhere."  In addition to better understanding the challenges these CISOs face, the 2021 Survey of CISOs with Small Security Teams delves into the strategies CISOs will employ to ensure their organizations are protected from the ongoing onslaught of cyber threats - all while saddled with limited budgets and headcount.  The survey findings will also be presented in a live webinar,&nbsp; register

With so much of the world transitioning to working, shopping, studying, and streaming online during the coronavirus pandemic, cybercriminals now have access to a larger base of potential victims than ever before.  "Zoombomb" &nbsp;became the new photobomb—hackers would gain access to a private meeting or online class hosted on Zoom and shout&nbsp; profanities and racial slurs &nbsp;or flash&nbsp; pornographic images . Nation-state hacker groups mounted attacks against organizations involved in the coronavirus pandemic response, including the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some in an attempt to politicize the pandemic.  Even garden-variety cyber attacks like email phishing, social engineering, and refund theft took on a darker flavor in response to the widespread economic precarity brought on by the pandemic.&nbsp;  "Hackers were mostly trying to take advantage of people's fear by offering medical equipment like thermometers and masks for cheap, low

In the Wake of the SolarWinds Hack, Here's How Businesses Should Respond<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/in-wake-of-solarwinds-hack-heres-how.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Throughout 2020, businesses, in general, have had their hands full with IT challenges. They had to rush to accommodate a sudden shift to remote work. Then they had to navigate a rapid adoption of automation technologies.  And as the year came to a close, more businesses began trying to assemble the safety infrastructure required to return to some semblance of normal in 2021.  But at the end of the year,&nbsp; news of a massive breach &nbsp;of IT monitoring software vendor SolarWinds introduced a new complication – the possibility of a wave of secondary data breaches and cyber-attacks. And because SolarWinds' products have a presence in so many business networks, the size of the threat is massive.  So far, though, most of the attention is getting paid to large enterprises like Microsoft and Cisco (and the US Government), who were the primary target of the SolarWinds breach. What nobody's talking about is the rest of the 18,000 or so SolarWinds clients who may have been affected. For them

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In 1982, when SMTP was first specified, it did not contain any mechanism for providing security at the transport level to secure communications between mail transfer agents.  Later, in 1999, the STARTTLS command was added to SMTP that in turn supported the encryption of emails in between the servers, providing the ability to convert a non-secure connection into a secure one that is encrypted using TLS protocol.  However, encryption is optional in SMTP, which implies that emails can be sent in plaintext.&nbsp; Mail Transfer Agent-Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) &nbsp;is a relatively new standard that enables mail service providers the ability to enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure SMTP connections and to specify whether the sending SMTP servers should refuse to deliver emails to MX hosts that that does not offer TLS with a reliable server certificate. It has been proven to successfully mitigate TLS downgrade attacks and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.  SMTP TLS Reporting (TLS-

In such a fast-paced field, organizations get real value from learning about others' penetration testing experiences, identifying trends, and the role they play in today's threat landscape.  While there is much to be gained from a single snapshot, additional value can come from long term data collection and year over year comparisons. We can see whether the effects that recent trends have on pen testing are long term, or simply a temporary shift, and how they affect the continuing evolution of penetration testing. For instance, 2020 saw a massive influx of remote work.  Unfortunately, the convenience of working safely from home increased the risk of a breach as countless new attack vectors opened up, both from the way employees connected to networks, as well a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Like it or not, 2020 was the year that proved that teams could work from literally anywhere.  While terms like "flex work" and "WFH" were thrown around before COVID-19 came around, thanks to the pandemic, remote working has become the defacto way people work nowadays. Today, digital-based work interactions take the place of in-person ones with near-seamless fluidity, and the best part is that going remote helps companies save their cash in this bootstrapped time.&nbsp;  But while the ability to work from anywhere has truly been essential to keeping businesses and the economy functional, it has opened up new challenges that need to be addressed.&nbsp;  Your Devices Are Your Weakest Link  With nearly ⅔ of employees still working remotely to some degree, the boundaries that once separated work and home have been completely washed away.

End-user passwords are one of the weakest components of your overall security protocols. Most users tend to reuse passwords across work and personal accounts.  They may also choose relatively weak passwords that satisfy company password policies but can be easily guessed or brute-forced. Your users may also inadvertently use&nbsp; breached passwords &nbsp;for their corporate account password.  The&nbsp; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) &nbsp;has a cybersecurity framework that helps organizations address common cybersecurity pitfalls in their environment, including weak, reused, and breached passwords. This post will take a closer look at the NIST password guidelines and see how you can effectively audit your password policies to ensure these meet the standards recommended by NIST.  NIST Password Guidelines and Best Practices  Specific guidance around passwords is addressed within the chapter titled&nbsp; Memorized Secret Verifiers . NIST has several recommendations in regards to passwords
