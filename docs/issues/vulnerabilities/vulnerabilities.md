Critical Flaw Found in Older Cisco Small Business Routers Won't Be Fixed<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/critical-flaw-found-in-older-cisco.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical vulnerability in Cisco Small Business Routers will not be patched by the networking equipment giant, since the devices reached end-of-life in 2019.  Tracked as CVE-2021-34730  (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue resides in the routers' Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) service, enabling an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability, which the company said is due to improper validation of incoming UPnP traffic, could be abused to send a specially-crafted UPnP request to an affected device, resulting in remote code execution as the root user on the underlying operating system.   "Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerability," the company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in an advisory published Wednesday. "The Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers have&nbsp; entered the end-of-life process .

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new class of vulnerabilities impacting major DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers that could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information from corporate networks.

Calling it a "bottomless well of valuable intel," the treasure trove of information contains internal and external IP addresses, computer names, employee names and locations, and details about organizations' web domains. The findings were&nbsp; presented &nbsp;at the Black Hat USA 2021 security conference last week.

A Critical Random Number Generator Flaw Affects Billions of IoT Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/a-critical-random-number-generator-flaw.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A critical vulnerability has been disclosed in hardware random number generators used in billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices whereby it fails to properly generate random numbers, thus undermining their security and putting them at risk of attacks.  "It turns out that these 'randomly' chosen numbers aren't always as random as you'd like when it comes to IoT devices," Bishop Fox researchers Dan Petro and Allan Cecil&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week. "In fact, in many cases, devices are choosing encryption keys of 0 or worse. This can lead to a catastrophic collapse of security for any upstream use."   Random number generation ( RNG ) is a&nbsp; crucial process &nbsp;that undergirds several cryptographic applications, including key generation, nonces, and salting. On traditional operating systems, it's derived from a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) that uses entropy obtained from a high-quality seed source.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Pulse Secure has shipped a fix for a critical post-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in its Connect Secure virtual private network (VPN) appliances to address an incomplete patch for an actively exploited flaw it previously resolved in October 2020.  "The Pulse Connect Secure appliance suffers from an uncontrolled archive extraction vulnerability which allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files, resulting in Remote Code Execution as root," NCC Group's Richard Warren&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;on Friday. "This vulnerability is a bypass of the patch for&nbsp; CVE-2020-8260 ."   "An attacker with such access will be able to circumvent any restrictions enforced via the web application, as well as remount the filesystem, allowing them to create a persistent backdoor, extract and decrypt credentials, compromise VPN clients, or pivot into the internal network," Warren added.  The disclosure comes days after Ivanti, the company behind Pulse Secure,&nbsp; p

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amazon earlier this April addressed a critical vulnerability in its Kindle e-book reader platform that could have been potentially exploited to take full control over a user's device, resulting in the theft of sensitive information by just deploying a malicious e-book.  "By sending Kindle users a single malicious e-book, a threat actor could have stolen any information stored on the device, from Amazon account credentials to billing information," Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point, said in an emailed statement. "The security vulnerabilities allow an attacker to target a very specific audience."   In other words, if a threat actor wanted to single out a specific group of people or demographic, it's possible for the adversary to choose a popular e-book in a language or dialect that's widely spoken among the group to tailor and orchestrate a highly targeted cyber attack.  Upon responsibly disclosing  the issue to Amazon in February 2021, t

India's Koo, a Twitter-like Service, Found Vulnerable to Critical Worm Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/indias-koo-twitter-like-service-found.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Koo, India's homegrown Twitter clone, recently patched a serious security vulnerability that could have been exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code against hundreds of thousands of its users, spreading the attack across the platform.  The vulnerability involves a&nbsp; stored cross-site scripting flaw &nbsp;(also known as persistent XSS) in Koo's web application that allows malicious scripts to be embedded directly into the affected web application.  To carry out the attack, all a malicious actor had to do was log into the service via the web application and post an XSS-encoded payload to its timeline, which automatically gets executed on behalf of all users who saw the post.   The issue was discovered by security researcher&nbsp; Rahul Kankrale &nbsp;in July, following which a fix was rolled out by Koo on July 3.  Using cross-site scripting, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of users with the same privileges as the user and steal web browser's secrets, such as authentication

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking equipment major Cisco has rolled out patches to address critical vulnerabilities impacting its Small Business VPN routers that could be abused by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and even cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.  The issues, tracked as CVE-2021-1609 (CVSS score: 9.8) and CVE-2021-1610 (CVSS score: 7.2), reside in the web-based management interface of the Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers running a firmware release prior to version 1.0.03.22. Both the issues stem from a lack of proper validation of HTTP requests, thus permitting a bad actor to send a specially-crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable device.   Successful exploitation of CVE-2021-1609 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. CVE-2021-1610, concerns a command injection vulnerability that, if exploited, could permit an authenticated adve

Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed a set of nine vulnerabilities known as " PwnedPiper " that left a widely-used pneumatic tube system (PTS) vulnerable to critical attacks, including a possibility of complete takeover.  The security weaknesses, disclosed by American cybersecurity firm Armis, impact the Translogic PTS system by Swisslog Healthcare, which is installed in about 80% of all major hospitals in North America and in no fewer than 3,000 hospitals worldwide.   "These vulnerabilities can enable an unauthenticated attacker to take over Translogic PTS stations and essentially gain complete control over the PTS network of a target hospital," Armis researchers Ben Seri and Barak Hadad said. "This type of control could enable sophisticated and worrisome ransomware attacks, as well as allow attackers to leak sensitive hospital information."  Pneumatic tube systems are internal logistics and transport solutions that are used to transport blood s

How to Mitigate Microsoft Windows 10, 11 SeriousSAM Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/how-to-mitigate-microsoft-windows-10-11.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are at risk of a new unpatched vulnerability that was recently disclosed publicly.  As we reported last week, the vulnerability — SeriousSAM  — allows attackers with low-level permissions to access Windows system files to perform a Pass-the-Hash (and potentially Silver Ticket) attack.&nbsp;  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to obtain hashed passwords stored in the Security Account Manager (SAM) and Registry, and ultimately run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.  SeriousSAM vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-36934 , exists in the default configuration of Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically due to a setting that allows 'read' permissions to the built-in user's group that contains all local users.  As a result, built-in local users have access to read the SAM files and the Registry, where they can also view the hashes. Once the attacker has 'User' access, they can use a tool such as Mimikatz to gain access to the Re

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
After more than 20 years in the making, now it's official: APIs are everywhere. In a 2021 survey,&nbsp; 73% of enterprises reported that they already publish more than 50 APIs , and this number is constantly growing.  APIs have crucial roles to play in virtually every industry today, and their importance is increasing steadily, as they move to the forefront of business strategies. This comes as no surprise: APIs seamlessly connect disparate apps and devices, bringing business synergies and efficiencies never witnessed before.&nbsp;  However, APIs have vulnerabilities just like any other component of the software. Adding to that, if they aren't rigorously tested from a security standpoint, they can also introduce a whole new array of attack surfaces and expose you to unprecedented risks. If you wait until production to discover API vulnerabilities, you can incur substantial delays.  APIs are attractive to attackers, not just businesses  Keep in mind that APIs do more than simply connect

Oracle on Tuesday released its quarterly&nbsp; Critical Patch Update for July 2021 &nbsp;with 342 fixes spanning across multiple products, some of which could be exploited by a remote attacker to take control of an affected system.  Chief among them is&nbsp; CVE-2019-2729 , a critical deserialization vulnerability via XMLDecoder in Oracle WebLogic Server Web Services that's remotely exploitable without authentication.

Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed multiple security vulnerabilities impacting CODESYS automation software and the WAGO programmable logic controller (PLC) platform that could be remotely exploited to take control of a company's cloud operational technology (OT) infrastructure.  The flaws can be turned "into innovative attacks that could put threat actors in position to remotely control a company's cloud OT implementation, and threaten any industrial process managed from the cloud," the New York-headquartered industrial security company Claroty said in a report  shared with The Hacker News, adding they "can be used to target a cloud-based management console from a compromised field device, or take over a company's cloud and attack PLCs and other devices to disrupt operations."

Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-3438 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8), the issue concerns a buffer overflow in a print driver installer package named "SSPORT.SYS" that can enable remote privilege and arbitrary code execution. Hundreds of millions of printers have been released worldwide to date with the vulnerable driver in question.  However, there is no evidence that the flaw was abused in real-world attacks.   "A potential buffer overflow in the software drivers for certain HP LaserJet products and Samsung product printers could lead to an escalation of privilege," according to an advisory published in May.  The issue was reported to HP by threat intelligence researchers from SentinelLabs on February 18, 2021, following which&nbsp; remedies &nbsp;have been&nbsp; published &nbsp;for the affected printers as of May 19, 2021.

The Wi-Fi network name bug that was found to completely disable an iPhone's networking functionality had remote code execution capabilities and was silently fixed by Apple earlier this year, according to new research.  The denial-of-service vulnerability,&nbsp; which came to light last month , stemmed from the way iOS handled string formats associated with the SSID input, triggering a crash on any up-to-date iPhone that connected to any wireless access points with percent symbols in their names such as "%p%s%s%s%s%n."  While the issue is remediable by resetting the network settings (Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings), Apple is&nbsp; expected to push a patch &nbsp;for the bug in its iOS 14.7 update, which is currently available to developers and public beta testers.   But in what could have had far-reaching consequences, researchers from mobile security automation firm ZecOps found that the same bug could be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Merely days after Microsoft sounded the alarm on an&nbsp; unpatched security vulnerability &nbsp;in the Windows Print Spooler service, yet another zero-day flaw in the same component has come to light, making it the fourth printer-related flaw to be discovered in recent weeks.  "Microsoft Windows allows for non-admin users to be able to install printer drivers via Point and Print," CERT Coordination Center's Will Dormann&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published Sunday. "Printers installed via this technique also install queue-specific files, which can be arbitrary libraries to be loaded by the privileged Windows Print Spooler process."   An exploit for the vulnerability was disclosed by security researcher and&nbsp; Mimikatz creator &nbsp; Benjamin Delpy .  #printnightmare  - Episode 4 You know what is better than a Legit Kiwi Printer ? 🥝Another Legit Kiwi Printer...👍 No prerequiste at all, you even don't need to sign drivers/package🤪 pic.twitter.com/oInb5jm3tE — 🥝 Benjamin Delpy (

CloudFlare CDNJS Bug Could Have Led to Widespread Supply-Chain Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/cloudflare-cdnjs-bug-could-have-led-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Web infrastructure and website security company Cloudflare last month fixed a critical vulnerability in its CDNJS library that's&nbsp; used by 12.7% of all websites &nbsp;on the internet.  CDNJS is a free and open-source content delivery network (CDN) that serves about&nbsp; 4,041 JavaScript and CSS libraries , making it the&nbsp; second most popular &nbsp;CDN for JavaScript after Google Hosted Libraries.  The weakness concerned an issue in the CDNJS library update server that could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to a complete compromise.   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by security researcher RyotaK on April 6, 2021. There is no evidence of in-the-wild attacks abusing this flaw.  Specifically, the vulnerability works by publishing packages to Cloudflare's CDNJS using GitHub and npm, using it to trigger a&nbsp; path traversal vulnerability , and ultimately trick the server into executing arbitrary code, thus achieving remote code execution.

Google has pushed out a new security update to Chrome browser for Windows, Mac, and Linux with multiple fixes, including a zero-day that it says is being exploited in the wild.  The latest patch resolves a total of eight issues, one of which concerns a type confusion issue in its V8 open-source and JavaScript engine ( CVE-2021-30563 ). The search giant credited an anonymous researcher for reporting the flaw on July 12.   As is usually the case with actively exploited flaws, the company issued a terse statement acknowledging that "an exploit for CVE-2021-30563 exists in the wild" while refraining from sharing full details about the underlying vulnerability used in the attacks due to its serious nature and the possibility that doing so could lead to further abuse.  CVE-2021-30563 also marks the ninth zero-day addressed by Google to combat real-world attacks against Chrome users since the start of the year —   CVE-2021-21148 &nbsp;- Heap buffer overflow in V8  CVE-2021-21166 &nbsp;- Obje

Microsoft Warns of New Unpatched Windows Print Spooler Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/microsoft-warns-of-new-unpatched.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Thursday shared fresh guidance on yet another vulnerability affecting the Windows Print Spooler service, stating that it's working to address it in an upcoming security update.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-34481 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the issue concerns a local privilege escalation flaw that could be abused to perform unauthorized actions on the system. The company credited security researcher Jacob Baines for discovering and reporting the bug.   "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Print Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges," the Windows maker said in its advisory. "An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights."  However, it's worth pointing out that successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires the attacker to have t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat intelligence researchers from Google on Wednesday&nbsp; shed more light &nbsp;on four in-the-wild zero-days in Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer browsers that were exploited by malicious actors in different campaigns since the start of the year.  What's more, three of the four zero-days were engineered by commercial providers and sold to and used by government-backed actors, contributing to an uptick in real-world attacks. The list of now-patched vulnerabilities is as follows -   CVE-2021-1879 : Use-After-Free in QuickTimePluginReplacement (Apple WebKit)  CVE-2021-21166 : Chrome Object Lifecycle Issue in Audio  CVE-2021-30551 : Chrome Type Confusion in V8  CVE-2021-33742 : Internet Explorer out-of-bounds write in MSHTML   Both Chrome zero-days — CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551 — are believed to have been used by the same actor, and were delivered as one-time links sent via email to targets located in Armenia, with the links redirecting unsuspecting users to attacker-controlled

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed new security vulnerabilities in the Etherpad text editor (version 1.8.13) that could potentially enable attackers to hijack administrator accounts, execute system commands, and even steal sensitive documents.  The two flaws — tracked as CVE-2021-34816  and CVE-2021-34817 — were discovered and reported on June 4 by researchers from SonarSource, following which patches have been shipped for the latter in&nbsp; version 1.8.14 &nbsp;of Etherpad released on July 4.  Etherpad is a real-time collaborative interface that enables a document to be edited simultaneously by multiple authors. It is an open-source alternative to Google Docs that can be self-hosted or used through one of the many third-party public  instances available.  "The XSS vulnerability allows attackers to take over Etherpad users, including admins.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity agencies in Australia and the U.S. are&nbsp; warning &nbsp;of an actively exploited vulnerability impacting ForgeRock's OpenAM access management solution that could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on an affected system remotely.  "The [Australian Cyber Security Centre] has observed actors exploiting this vulnerability to compromise multiple hosts and deploy additional malware and tools," the organization&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an alert. ACSC didn't disclose the nature of the attacks, how widespread they are, or the identities of the threat actors exploiting them.   Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-35464 , the issue concerns a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in ForgeRock Access Manager identity and access management tool, and stems from an&nbsp; unsafe Java deserialization &nbsp;in the Jato framework used by the software.   "An attacker exploiting the vulnerability will execute commands in the context of the current user, not as the root user (unless ForgeRo

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
SolarWinds, the Texas-based company that became the epicenter of a&nbsp; massive supply chain attack &nbsp;late last year, has issued patches to contain a remote code execution flaw in its Serv-U managed file transfer service.  The fixes, which target Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP products, arrive after Microsoft notified the IT management and remote monitoring software maker that the flaw was being exploited in the wild. The threat actor behind the exploitation remains unknown as yet, and it isn't clear exactly how the attack was carried out.   "Microsoft has provided evidence of limited, targeted customer impact, though SolarWinds does not currently have an estimate of how many customers may be directly affected by the vulnerability," SolarWinds&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published Friday, adding it's "unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers."

Florida-based software vendor Kaseya on Sunday&nbsp;rolled out urgent updates to address critical security vulnerabilities in its Virtual System Administrator (VSA) solution that was used as a jumping off point to target as many as 1,500 businesses across the globe as part of a widespread supply-chain ransomware attack .  Following the incident, the company had urged on-premises VSA customers to shut down their servers until a patch was available. Now, almost 10 days later the firm has shipped VSA version 9.5.7a (9.5.7.2994)  with fixes for three new security flaws —&nbsp;   CVE-2021-30116  - Credentials leak and business logic flaw  CVE-2021-30119  - Cross-site scripting vulnerability  CVE-2021-30120  - Two-factor authentication bypass   The security issues are part of a total of seven vulnerabilities that were discovered and reported to Kaseya by the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure ( DIVD ) earlier in April, of which four other weaknesses were remediated in previous releases —

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
This week, PrintNightmare  - Microsoft's Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) was upgraded from a 'Low' criticality to a 'Critical' criticality.  This is due to a Proof of Concept published on GitHub, which attackers could potentially leverage for gaining access to Domain Controllers.  As we reported earlier , Microsoft already released a patch in June 2021, but it wasn't enough to stop exploits. Attackers can still use Print Spooler when connecting remotely. You can find all you need to know about this vulnerability in this article and how you can mitigate it (and you can).&nbsp;  Print Spooler in a nutshell: &nbsp;Print Spooler is Microsoft's service for managing and monitoring files printing. This service is among Microsoft's oldest and has had minimal maintenance updates since it was released.&nbsp;  Every Microsoft machine (servers and endpoints) has this feature enabled by default.

Microsoft's Emergency Patch Fails to Fully Fix PrintNightmare RCE Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/microsofts-emergency-patch-fails-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Even as Microsoft&nbsp; expanded patches &nbsp;for the so-called PrintNightmare vulnerability for Windows 10 version 1607, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016, it has come to light that the fix for the remote code execution exploit in the Windows Print Spooler service can be bypassed in certain scenarios, effectively defeating the security protections and permitting attackers to run arbitrary code on infected systems.  On Tuesday, the Windows maker issued an&nbsp; emergency out-of-band update &nbsp;to address&nbsp; CVE-2021-34527 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.8) after the flaw was accidentally disclosed by researchers from Hong Kong-based cybersecurity firm Sangfor late last month, at which point it emerged that the issue was different from another bug — tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-1675 &nbsp;— that was patched by Microsoft on June 8.   "Several days ago, two security vulnerabilities were found in Microsoft Windows' existing printing mechanism," Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point, told The Hacke

An analysis of off-the-shelf packages hosted on the NuGet repository has revealed 51 unique software components to be vulnerable to actively exploited, high-severity vulnerabilities, once again underscoring the threat posed by third-party dependencies to the software development process.  In light of the growing number of cyber incidents that target the software supply chain, there is an urgent need to assess such third-party modules for any security risks and minimize the attack surface, ReversingLabs researcher Karlo Zanki said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  NuGet &nbsp;is a Microsoft-supported mechanism for the .NET platform and functions as a package manager designed to enable developers to share reusable code. The framework maintains a central repository of over 264,000 unique packages that have collectively produced more than 109 billion package downloads.

Microsoft is urging Azure users to&nbsp; update &nbsp;the PowerShell command-line tool as soon as possible to protect against a critical remote code execution vulnerability impacting .NET Core.  The issue, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-26701 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 8.1), affects PowerShell versions 7.0 and 7.1 and have been remediated in versions 7.0.6 and 7.1.3, respectively. Windows PowerShell 5.1 isn't impacted by the flaw.  Built on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR),&nbsp; PowerShell &nbsp;is a cross-platform task automation utility that consists of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework.   "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET 5 and .NET Core due to how text encoding is performed," the company&nbsp; noted in an advisory &nbsp;published earlier this April, adding that the problem resides in the " System.Text.Encodings.Web " package, which provides types for encoding and escaping strings for use in JavaScript, HTML, and URLs.

More specifics about the flaws were not shared, but DIVD chair Victor Gevers&nbsp; hinted &nbsp;that the zero-days are trivial to exploit.

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed critical security vulnerabilities affecting&nbsp; NETGEAR DGN2200v1 series routers , which they say could be reliably abused as a jumping-off point to compromise a network's security and gain unfettered access.  The three&nbsp; HTTPd &nbsp;authentication security weaknesses (CVSS scores: 7.1 – 9.4) impact routers running firmware versions prior to v1.0.0.60, and have since been&nbsp; fixed by the company &nbsp;in December 2020 as part of a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.   "The rising number of firmware attacks and ransomware attacks via VPN devices and other internet-facing systems are examples of attacks initiated outside and below the operating system layer," Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team's Jonathan Bar Or&nbsp; said . "As these types of attacks become more common, users must look to secure even the single-purpose software that run their hardware—like routers."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit related to a remote code execution vulnerability affecting Windows Print Spooler and patched by Microsoft earlier this month was briefly published online before being taken down.  Identified as&nbsp; CVE-2021-1675 , the security issue could grant remote attackers full control of vulnerable systems.&nbsp; Print Spooler &nbsp;manages the printing process in Windows, including loading the appropriate printer drivers, and scheduling the print job for printing, among others.  Print Spooler flaws are concerning, not least because of the wide attack surface, but also owing to the fact that it runs at the highest privilege level and is capable of dynamically loading third-party binaries.   "Either the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate

Unpatched Virtual Machine Takeover Bug Affects Google Compute Engine<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/unpatched-virtual-machine-takeover-bug.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unpatched security vulnerability affecting Google's Compute Engine platform could be abused by an attacker to take over virtual machines over the network.  "This is done by impersonating the metadata server from the targeted virtual machine's point of view," security researcher Imre Rad said in an&nbsp; analysis &nbsp;published Friday. "By mounting this exploit, the attacker can grant access to themselves over SSH (public key authentication) so then they can login as the root user."  Google Compute Engine ( GCE ) is an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) component of Google Cloud Platform that enables users to create and launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand. GCE provides a method for storing and retrieving metadata in the form of the&nbsp; metadata server , which offers a central point to set metadata in the form of key-value pairs that's then provided to virtual machines at runtime.   According to the researcher, the issue is a consequence of weak pseudo-random

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft last week rolled out updates for the Edge browser with&nbsp; fixes for two security issues , one of which concerns a security bypass vulnerability that could be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary code in the context of any website.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-34506 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.4), the weakness stems from a universal cross-site scripting (UXSS) issue that's triggered when automatically translating web pages using the browser's&nbsp; built-in feature via Microsoft Translator .   Credited for discovering and reporting CVE-2021-34506 are Ignacio Laurence as well as Vansh Devgan and Shivam Kumar Singh with CyberXplore Private Limited.&nbsp;  "Unlike the common XSS attacks, UXSS is a type of attack that exploits client-side vulnerabilities in the browser or browser extensions in order to generate an XSS condition, and execute malicious code," CyberXplore researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up shared with The Hacker News.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A security vulnerability in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) that was addressed by the company last October and again earlier this April, has been subjected to active in-the-wild attacks following the release of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code.  The PoC was&nbsp; published &nbsp;by researchers from cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies on June 24, following which reports emerged that attackers are chasing after an exploit for the bug.   "Tenable has also received a report that attackers are exploiting CVE-2020-3580 in the wild," the cyber exposure company&nbsp; said .   Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2020-3580 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 6.1), the issue concerns multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco ASA software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on an affected device.  As of July 2020, there were a little over&nbsp; 85,000 ASA/FTD devices , 398 of which are spread across

Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday disclosed a chain of vulnerabilities affecting the BIOSConnect feature within Dell Client BIOS that could be abused by a privileged network adversary to gain arbitrary code execution at the BIOS/UEFI level of the affected device.  "As the attacker has the ability to remotely execute code in the pre-boot environment, this can be used to subvert the operating system and undermine fundamental trust in the device," researchers from enterprise device security firm Eclypsium said . "The virtually unlimited control over a device that this attack can provide makes the fruit of the labor well worth it for the attacker."   In all, the flaws affect 128 Dell models spanning across consumer and business laptops, desktops, and tablets, totalling an estimated 30 million individual devices.

Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed critical flaws in the Atlassian project and software development platform that could be exploited to take over an account and control some of the apps connected through its single sign-on ( SSO ) capability.  "With just one click, an attacker could have used the flaws to get access to Atlassian's publish Jira system and get sensitive information, such as security issues on Atlassian cloud, Bitbucket and on premise products," Check Point Research said  in an analysis shared with The Hacker News.   After the issues were reported to Atlassian on Jan. 8, 2021, the Australian company deployed a fix as part of its&nbsp; updates &nbsp;rolled out on&nbsp; May 18 . The sub-domains affected by the flaws include -&nbsp;   jira.atlassian.com  confluence.atlassian.com  getsupport.atlassian.com  partners.atlassian.com  developer.atlassian.com  support.atlassian.com  training.atlassian.com   Successful exploitation of these flaws could result in a supply-ch

VMware has rolled out security updates to resolve a critical flaw affecting Carbon Black App Control that could be exploited to bypass authentication and take control of vulnerable systems.  The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-21998, is rated 9.4 out of 10 in severity by the industry-standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and affects App Control (AppC) versions 8.0.x, 8.1.x, 8.5.x, and 8.6.x.  Carbon Black App Control &nbsp;is a security solution designed to lock down critical systems and servers to prevent unauthorized changes in the face of cyber-attacks and ensure compliance with regulatory mandates such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, FISMA, and NERC.

Open-source Tor browser has been updated to version 10.0.18 with fixes for multiple issues, including a privacy-defeating bug that could be used to uniquely fingerprint users across different browsers based on the apps installed on a computer.  In addition to&nbsp; updating &nbsp;Tor to 0.4.5.9, the browser's Android version has been upgraded to Firefox to version 89.1.1, alongside incorporating patches rolled out by Mozilla for several&nbsp; security vulnerabilities &nbsp;addressed in Firefox 89.   Chief among the rectified issues is a new fingerprinting attack that came to light last month. Dubbed&nbsp; scheme flooding , the vulnerability enables a malicious website to leverage information about installed apps on the system to assign users a permanent unique identifier even when they switch browsers, use incognito mode, or a VPN.  Put differently, the&nbsp; weakness &nbsp;takes advantage of custom URL schemes in apps as an attack vector, allowing a bad actor to track a device's user between different browsers

A critical vulnerability in SonicWall VPN appliances that was believed to have been patched last year has been now found to be "botched," with the company leaving a memory leak flaw unaddressed, until now, that could permit a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.  The shortcoming was rectified in an update rolled out to SonicOS on June 22.&nbsp;  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-20019 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 5.3), the vulnerability is the consequence of a memory leak when sending a specially-crafted unauthenticated HTTP request, culminating in information disclosure.   It's worth noting that SonicWall's decision to hold back the patch comes amid&nbsp; multiple &nbsp; zero-day &nbsp; disclosures &nbsp;affecting its remote access VPN and email security products that have been exploited in a series of in-the-wild attacks to deploy backdoors and a new strain of ransomware called FIVEHANDS.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new research published by a group of academics has found that anti-virus programs for Android continue to remain vulnerable against different permutations of malware, in what could pose a serious risk as malicious actors evolve their toolsets to better evade analysis.  "Malware writers use stealthy mutations (morphing/obfuscations) to continuously develop malware clones, thwarting detection by signature based detectors," the researchers&nbsp; said . "This attack of clones seriously threatens all the mobile platforms, especially Android."   The findings were published in a study last week by researchers from Adana Science and Technology University, Turkey, and the National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.  Unlike iOS, apps can be downloaded from third-party sources on Android devices, raising the possibility that unwitting users can install unverified and lookalike apps that clone a legitimate app's functionality but are built to trick tar

South Korea's state-run Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) on Friday disclosed that its internal network was infiltrated by suspected attackers operating out of its northern counterpart.  The intrusion is said to have taken place on May 14 through a vulnerability in an unnamed virtual private network (VPN) vendor and involved a&nbsp; total of 13 IP addresses , one of which — "27.102.114[.]89" — has been previously linked to a state-sponsored threat actor dubbed&nbsp; Kimsuky .   KAERI, established in 1959 and situated in the city of Daejeon, is a government-funded research institute that designs and develops nuclear technologies related to reactors, fuel rods, radiation fusion, and nuclear safety.  Following the intrusion, the think tank said it took steps to block the attacker's IP addresses in question and applied necessary security patches to the vulnerable VPN solution.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday issued an advisory regarding a critical software supply-chain flaw impacting ThroughTek's software development kit (SDK) that could be abused by an adversary to gain improper access to audio and video streams.  "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could permit unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as camera audio/video feeds," CISA&nbsp; said &nbsp;in the alert.  ThroughTek's point-to-point ( P2P ) SDK is widely used by IoT devices with video surveillance or audio/video transmission capability such as IP cameras, baby and pet monitoring cameras, smart home appliances, and sensors to provide remote access to the media content over the internet.   Tracked as CVE-2021-32934 (CVSS score: 9.1), the shortcoming affects ThroughTek P2P products, versions 3.1.5 and before as well as SDK versions with nossl tag, and stems from a lack of sufficient protection when transferring data between

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A seven-year-old privilege escalation vulnerability discovered in the polkit system service could be exploited by a malicious unprivileged local attacker to bypass authorization and escalate permissions to the root user.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-3560 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 7.8), the flaw affects polkit versions between 0.113 and 0.118 and was discovered by GitHub security researcher Kevin Backhouse, who said the issue was&nbsp; introduced in a code commit &nbsp;made on Nov. 9, 2013. Red Hat's Cedric Buissart&nbsp; noted &nbsp;that Debian-based distributions, based on polkit 0.105, are also vulnerable.   Polkit &nbsp;(née PolicyKit) is a toolkit for defining and handling authorizations in Linux distributions, and is used for allowing unprivileged processes to communicate with privileged processes.  "When a requesting process disconnects from dbus-daemon just before the call to polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync starts, the process cannot get a unique uid and pid of the process and it cannot verify the privileg

Attention readers, if you are using Google Chrome browser on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computers, you need to update it immediately to the latest version Google released earlier today.  Google on Wednesday rolled out an urgent update for Chrome browser to address 14 newly discovered security issues, including a zero-day flaw that it says is being actively exploited in the wild.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-30551 , the vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue in its V8 open-source and JavaScript engine. Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw.   Although the search giant's Chrome team issued a terse statement acknowledging "an exploit for CVE-2021-30551 exists in the wild," Shane Huntley, Director of Google's Threat Analysis Group,&nbsp; hinted &nbsp;that the vulnerability was leveraged by the same actor that abused&nbsp; CVE-2021-33742 , an actively exploited remote code execution flaw in Windows MSHTML platform that was ad

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Four security vulnerabilities discovered in the Microsoft Office suite, including Excel and Office online, could be potentially abused by bad actors to deliver attack code via Word and Excel documents.  "Rooted from legacy code, the vulnerabilities could have granted an attacker the ability to execute code on targets via malicious Office documents, such as Word, Excel and Outlook," researchers from Check Point research said in a report published  today.  Three of the four flaws — tracked as CVE-2021-31174, CVE-2021-31178, CVE-2021-31179 — have been fixed by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday update  for May 2021, with the fourth patch (CVE-2021-31939) to be issued in June's update rolling out later today.   In a hypothetical attack scenario, the researchers said the vulnerability could be triggered as simply as opening a malicious Excel (.XLS) file that's served via a download link or an email.  Arising out of parsing mistakes made in legacy code found in Excel 9

Malicious actors are actively mass scanning the internet for vulnerable VMware vCenter servers that are unpatched against a critical remote code execution flaw, which the company addressed late last month.  The ongoing activity was detected by Bad Packets on June 3 and corroborated&nbsp; yesterday &nbsp;by security researcher Kevin Beaumont. "Mass scanning activity detected from 104.40.252.159 checking for VMware vSphere hosts vulnerable to remote code execution,"&nbsp; tweeted &nbsp;Troy Mursch, chief research officer at Bad Packets.   The development follows the publication of a proof-of-concept  (PoC) RCE exploit code targeting the VMware vCenter bug.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-21985 &nbsp;(CVSS score 9.8), the issue is a consequence of a lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN (vSAN) Health Check plug-in, which could be abused by an attacker to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts the vCenter Server.   Although the flaw was rectified by VMwar

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday disclosed as many as ten critical vulnerabilities impacting CODESYS automation software that could be exploited to remote code execution on programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  "To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker does not need a username or password; having network access to the industrial controller is enough," researchers from Positive Technologies&nbsp; said . "The main cause of the vulnerabilities is insufficient verification of input data, which may itself be caused by failure to comply with the secure development recommendations."  The Russian cybersecurity firm noted that it detected the vulnerabilities on a PLC offered by WAGO, which, among other automation technology companies such as Beckhoff, Kontron, Moeller, Festo, Mitsubishi, and HollySys, use CODESYS software for&nbsp; programming and configuring &nbsp;the controllers.

Major software vulnerabilities are a fact of life, as illustrated by the fact that Microsoft has patched between 55 and 110 vulnerabilities each month this year – with 7% to 17% of those vulnerabilities being critical.  May had the fewest vulnerabilities, with a total of 55 and only four considered critical. The problem is that the critical vulnerabilities are things we have seen for many years, like remote code execution and privilege escalation.  Microsoft isn't the only big name regularly patching major vulnerabilities: We see monthly security updates coming from Apple, Adobe, Google, Cisco, and others.  Everything old is new again  With major vulnerabilities in so many applications, is there any hope for a secure future? The answer is, of course, yes, but that does not mean there won't be challenges getting there.  The vulnerabilities being seen may not be new to those of us who have been defending against attackers  for years or even decades, but the adversaries continual

A new set of critical vulnerabilities has been disclosed in the Realtek RTL8170C Wi-Fi module that an adversary could abuse to gain elevated privileges on a device and hijack wireless communications.  "Successful exploitation would lead to complete control of the Wi-Fi module and potential root access on the OS (such as Linux or Android) of the embedded device that uses this module," researchers from Israeli IoT security firm Vdoo&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published yesterday.  The Realtek&nbsp; RTL8710C &nbsp;Wi-Fi SoC underpins Ameba, an Arduino-compatible programmable platform equipped with peripheral interfaces for building a variety of IoT applications by devices spanning across agriculture, automotive, energy, healthcare, industrial, security, and smart home sectors.

Fancy Product Designer is a tool that enables businesses to offer customizable products, allowing customers to design any kind of item ranging from T-shirts to phone cases by offering the ability to upload images and PDF files that can be added to the products.   "Unfortunately, while the plugin had some checks in place to prevent malicious files from being uploaded, these checks were insufficient and could easily be bypassed, allowing attackers to upload executable PHP files to any site with the plugin installed," Wordfence

A New Bug in Siemens PLCs Could Let Hackers Run Malicious Code Remotely<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/a-new-bug-in-siemens-plcs-could-let.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Siemens on Friday shipped firmed updates to address a severe vulnerability in SIMATIC S7-1200 and S7-1500 programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that could be exploited by a malicious actor to remotely gain access to protected areas of the memory and achieve unrestricted and undetected code execution, in what the researchers describe as an attacker's "holy grail."  The memory protection bypass vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-15782 (CVSS score: 8.1), was discovered by operational technology security company Claroty by reverse-engineering the MC7 / MC7+ bytecode language used to execute PLC programs in the microprocessor. There's no evidence that the weakness was abused in the wild.   In an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;issued by Siemens, the German industrial automation firm said an unauthenticated, remote attacker with network access to TCP port 102 could potentially write arbitrary data and code to protected memory areas or read sensitive data to launch further attacks.

Severe security flaws uncovered in popular Visual Studio Code extensions could enable attackers to compromise local machines as well as build and deployment systems through a developer's integrated development environment (IDE).  The vulnerable extensions could be exploited to run arbitrary code on a developer's system remotely, in what could ultimately pave the way for supply chain attacks.  Some of the extensions in question are "LaTeX Workshop," "Rainbow Fart," "Open in Default Browser," and "Instant Markdown," all of which have cumulatively racked up about two million installations between them.  "Developer machines usually hold significant credentials, allowing them (directly or indirectly) to interact with many parts of the product," researchers from open-source security platform Synk&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive published on May 26.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
VMware has rolled out patches to address a critical security vulnerability in vCenter Server that could be leveraged by an adversary to execute arbitrary code on the server.  Tracked as CVE-2021-21985 (CVSS score 9.8), the issue stems from a lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN ( vSAN ) Health Check plug-in, which is enabled by default in the vCenter Server. "A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server," VMware&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its advisory.   VMware vCenter Server is a server management utility that's used to control virtual machines, ESXi hosts, and other dependent components from a single centralized location. The flaw affects vCenter Server versions 6.5, 6.7, and 7.0 and Cloud Foundation versions 3.x and 4.x. VMware credited Ricter Z of 360 Noah Lab for reporting the vulnerability.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Adversaries could exploit newly discovered security weaknesses in Bluetooth Core and Mesh Profile Specifications to masquerade as legitimate devices and carry out man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  "Devices supporting the Bluetooth&nbsp; Core &nbsp;and&nbsp; Mesh Specifications &nbsp;are vulnerable to impersonation attacks and AuthValue disclosure that could allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate device during pairing," the Carnegie Mellon CERT Coordination Center&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published Monday.  The two Bluetooth specifications define the standard that allows for many-to-many communication over Bluetooth to facilitate data transfer between devices in an ad-hoc network.   The Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS, aka BIAS , enable a malicious actor to establish a secure connection with a victim, without having to know and authenticate the long-term key shared between the victims, thus effectively bypassing Bluetooth's authentication mechanism.  "The BIAS attacks are the first

Apple on Monday rolled out security updates for&nbsp; iOS ,&nbsp; macOS ,&nbsp; tvOS ,&nbsp; watchOS , and&nbsp; Safari &nbsp;web browser to fix multiple vulnerabilities, including an actively exploited zero-day flaw in macOS Big Sur and expand patches for two previously disclosed zero-day flaws.&nbsp;  Tracked as CVE-2021-30713, the zero-day concerns a permissions issue in Apple's Transparency, Consent, and Control ( TCC ) framework in macOS that maintains a database of each user's consents. The iPhone maker acknowledged that the issue may have been exploited in the wild but stopped short of sharing specifics.   The company noted that it rectified the problem with improved validation.  However, in a separate report, mobile device management company Jamf said the bypass flaw was being actively exploited by XCSSET, a malware that's been out in the wild since August 2020 and known to propagate via modified&nbsp; Xcode IDE projects &nbsp;hosted on GitHub repositories and plant malicious packages into legitimate apps ins

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers disclosed details about 13 vulnerabilities in the Nagios network monitoring application that could be abused by an adversary to hijack the infrastructure without any operator intervention.  "In a telco setting, where a telco is monitoring thousands of sites, if a customer site is fully compromised, an attacker can use the vulnerabilities to compromise the telco, and then every other monitored customer site," Adi Ashkenazy, CEO of Australian cybersecurity firm Skylight Cyber, told The Hacker News via email.  Nagios is an open-source IT infrastructure tool analogous to SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM) that offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, network cards, applications, and services.  The issues, which consist of a mix of authenticated remote code execution (RCE) and privilege escalation flaws, were discovered and reported to Nagios in October 2020, following which they were&nbsp; remediated &nbsp;in&nbsp; November .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Three design and multiple implementation flaws have been disclosed in IEEE 802.11 technical standard that undergirds Wi-Fi, potentially enabling an adversary to take control over a system and plunder confidential data.  Called&nbsp; FragAttacks &nbsp;(short for FRgmentation and AGgregation attacks), the weaknesses impact all Wi-Fi security protocols, from Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) all the way to Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3), thus virtually putting almost every wireless-enabled device at risk of attack.  "An adversary that is within radio range of a victim can abuse these vulnerabilities to steal user information or attack devices," Mathy Vanhoef, a security academic at New York University Abu Dhabi, said. "Experiments indicate that every Wi-Fi product is affected by at least one vulnerability and that most products are affected by several vulnerabilities."  IEEE 802.11 provides the basis for all modern devices using the Wi-Fi family of network protocols, allowing lap

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Tuesday rolled out its scheduled&nbsp; monthly security update &nbsp;with patches for 55 security flaws affecting Windows, Exchange Server, Internet Explorer, Office, Hyper-V, Visual Studio, and Skype for Business.  Of these 55 bugs, four are rated as Critical, 50 are rated as Important, and one is listed as Moderate in severity. Three of the vulnerabilities are publicly known, although, unlike&nbsp; last month , none of them are under active exploitation at the time of release.   The most critical of the flaws addressed is&nbsp; CVE-2021-31166 , a wormable remote code execution vulnerability in the HTTP protocol stack. The issue, which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted packet to a targeted server, is rated 9.8 out of a maximum of 10 on the CVSS scale.  Another vulnerability of note is a remote code execution flaw in Hyper-V ( CVE-2021-28476 ), which also scores  the highest severity among all flaws patched this month with a CVSS rating of 9.9.

Top 11 Security Flaws Russian Spy Hackers Are Exploiting in the Wild<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/top-11-security-flaws-russian-spy.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber operatives affiliated with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) have switched up their tactics in response to previous public disclosures  of their attack methods, according to a&nbsp; new advisory &nbsp;jointly published by intelligence agencies from the U.K. and U.S. Friday.  "SVR cyber operators appear to have reacted [...] by changing their TTPs in an attempt to avoid further detection and remediation efforts by network defenders," the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)&nbsp; said .  These include the deployment of an open-source tool called&nbsp; Sliver &nbsp;to maintain their access to compromised victims as well as leveraging the ProxyLogon flaws in Microsoft Exchange servers to conduct post-exploitation activities.   The development followed the&nbsp; public attribution &nbsp;of SVR-linked actors to the&nbsp; SolarWinds &nbsp;supply-chain attack last month. The adversary is also tracked under different monikers, such as Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT29), the Dukes, CozyBear, and Yttrium.

As many as six zero-days have been uncovered in an application called Remote Mouse, allowing a remote attacker to achieve full code execution without any user interaction.  The unpatched flaws, collectively named ' Mouse Trap, ' were disclosed on Wednesday by security researcher Axel Persinger, who said, "It's clear that this application is very vulnerable and puts users at risk with bad authentication mechanisms, lack of encryption, and poor default configuration."   Remote Mouse is a remote control application for Android and iOS that turns mobile phones and tablets into a wireless mouse, keyboard, and trackpad for computers, with support for voice typing, adjusting computer volume, and switching between applications with the help of a Remote Mouse server installed on the machine. The Android app alone has been installed over 10 million times.  In a nutshell, the issues, which were identified by analysing the packets sent from the Android app to its Windows ser

New tsuNAME Flaw Could Let Attackers Take Down Authoritative DNS Servers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/new-tsuname-flaw-could-let-attackers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers Thursday disclosed a new critical vulnerability affecting Domain Name System (DNS) resolvers that could be exploited by adversaries to carry out denial-of-service attacks against authoritative nameservers.  The flaw, called&nbsp; 'TsuNAME ,' was discovered by researchers from SIDN Labs and InternetNZ, which manage the national top-level internet domains '.nl' and '.nz' for the Netherlands and New Zealand, respectively.  "TsuNAME occurs when domain names are misconfigured with cyclic dependent DNS records, and when vulnerable resolvers access these misconfigurations, they begin looping and send DNS queries rapidly to authoritative servers and other resolvers," the researchers said.   A recursive DNS resolver is one of the core components involved in&nbsp; DNS resolution , i.e., converting a hostname such as www.google.com into a computer-friendly IP address like 142.250.71.36. To achieve this, it responds to a client's request for a web

Networking equipment major Cisco has rolled out software updates to address multiple critical vulnerabilities impacting HyperFlex HX and SD-WAN vManage Software that could allow an attacker to perform command injection attacks, execute arbitrary code, and gain access to sensitive information.  In a series of advisories published on May 5, the company said there are no workarounds that remediate the issues.  The HyperFlex HX command injection vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2021-1497 and CVE-2021-1498 (CVSS scores 9.8), affect all Cisco devices running HyperFlex HX software versions 4.0, 4.5, and those prior to 4.0. Arising due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform, the flaws could enable an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack against a vulnerable device.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new security vulnerability in Qualcomm's mobile station modems (MSM) that could potentially allow an attacker to leverage the underlying Android operating system to slip malicious code into mobile phones, undetected.  "If exploited, the vulnerability would have allowed an attacker to use Android OS itself as an entry point to inject malicious and invisible code into phones, granting them access to SMS messages and audio of phone conversations," researchers from Israeli security firm Check Point&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published today.  The heap overflow vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-11292 , resides in the QMI voice service API exposed by the modem to the high level operating system, and could be exploited by a malicious app to conceal its activities "underneath" the OS in the modem chip itself, thus making it invisible to the security protections built into the device.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When Spectre, a class of critical vulnerabilities impacting modern processors, was&nbsp; publicly revealed &nbsp;in January 2018, the researchers behind the discovery&nbsp; said , "As it is not easy to fix, it will haunt us for quite some time," explaining the inspiration behind naming the speculative execution attacks.  Indeed, it's been more than three years, and there is no end to Spectre in sight.  A team of academics from the University of Virginia and University of California, San Diego, have discovered a&nbsp; new line of attack &nbsp;that bypasses all current Spectre protections built into the chips, potentially putting almost every system — desktops, laptops, cloud servers, and smartphones — once again at risk just as they were three years ago.   The disclosure of&nbsp; Spectre and Meltdown &nbsp;opened a&nbsp; floodgates &nbsp;of sorts, what with&nbsp; endless &nbsp; variants &nbsp;of the&nbsp; attacks &nbsp;coming to light in the intervening years, even as chipmakers like Intel, ARM, and AMD have continually scrambled to incorpo

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new academic study has highlighted a number of privacy and security pitfalls associated with recycling mobile phone numbers that could be abused to stage a variety of exploits, including account takeovers, conduct phishing and spam attacks, and even prevent victims from signing up for online services.  Nearly 66% of the recycled numbers that were sampled were found to be tied to previous owners' online accounts at popular websites, potentially enabling account hijacks by simply recovering the accounts tied to those numbers.  "An attacker can cycle through the available numbers shown on online number change interfaces and check if any of them are associated with online accounts of previous owners," the researchers&nbsp; said . If so, the attacker can then obtain these numbers and reset the password on the accounts, and receive and correctly enter the OTP sent via SMS upon login."   The findings are part of an analysis of a sample of 259 phone numbers available to new su

PC maker Dell has issued an update to fix multiple critical privilege escalation vulnerabilities that went undetected since 2009, potentially allowing attackers to gain kernel-mode privileges and cause a denial-of-service condition.  The issues, reported to Dell by researchers from SentinelOne on Dec. 1, 2020, reside in a firmware update driver named "dbutil_2_3.sys" that comes pre-installed on its devices. Hundreds of millions of desktops, laptops, notebooks, and tablets manufactured by the company are said to be vulnerable.   "Dell dbutil_2_3.sys driver contains an insufficient access control vulnerability which may lead to escalation of privileges, denial-of-service, or information disclosure. Local authenticated user access is required," Dell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.  All five separate flaws have been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2021-21551 with a CVSS score of 8.8. A breakdown of the shortcomings is as follows -&nbsp;   CVE-2021-21551: Local Elevation Of Privilege

Ivanti, the company behind Pulse Secure VPN appliances, has released a security patch to remediate a critical security vulnerability that was found being actively exploited in the wild by at least two different threat actors.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-22893 &nbsp;(CVSS score 10), the flaw concerns "multiple use after free" issues in Pulse Connect Secure that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code and take control of the affected system. All Pulse Connect Secure versions prior to 9.1R11.4 are impacted.   The flaw came to light on April 20 after FireEye&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a series of intrusions targeting defense, government, and financial organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere by leveraging critical vulnerabilities in the remote access solution to bypass multi-factor authentication protections and breach enterprise networks.  The development promoted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue an&nbsp; Emergency Directive &nbsp;urging fede

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft researchers on Thursday disclosed two dozen vulnerabilities affecting a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology (OT) devices used in industrial, medical, and enterprise networks that could be abused by adversaries to execute arbitrary code and even cause critical systems to crash.  "These remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities cover more than 25 CVEs and potentially affect a wide range of domains, from consumer and medical IoT to Industrial IoT, Operational Technology, and industrial control systems,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Microsoft's 'Section 52' Azure Defender for IoT research group.  The flaws have been collectively named " BadAlloc ," for they are rooted in standard&nbsp; memory allocation functions &nbsp;spanning widely used real-time operating systems (RTOS), embedded software development kits (SDKs), and C standard library (libc) implementations. A lack of proper input validations associated with these memory allocation functions

F5 BIG-IP Found Vulnerable to Kerberos KDC Spoofing Vulnerability<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/f5-big-ip-found-vulnerable-to-kerberos.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed a new bypass vulnerability in the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) security feature impacting F5 Big-IP application delivery services.  "The KDC Spoofing vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the Kerberos authentication to Big-IP Access Policy Manager (APM), bypass security policies and gain unfettered access to sensitive workloads," Silverfort researchers Yaron Kassner and Rotem Zach said in a report. "In some cases this can be used to bypass authentication to the Big-IP admin console as well."  Coinciding with the public disclosure, F5 has released a patch to address the weakness.   Kerberos &nbsp;is an authentication protocol that relies on a client-server model for mutual authentication and requires a trusted intermediary called Key Distribution Center ( KDC ) — a Kerberos Authentication Server (AS) or a Ticket Granting Server in this case — that acts as a repository of shared secret keys of all users as we

New research has uncovered privacy weaknesses in Apple's wireless file-sharing protocol that could result in the exposure of a user's contact information such as email addresses and phone numbers.  "As an attacker, it is possible to learn the phone numbers and email addresses of AirDrop users – even as a complete stranger,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;a team of academics from the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. "All they require is a Wi-Fi-capable device and physical proximity to a target that initiates the discovery process by opening the sharing pane on an iOS or macOS device."  AirDrop &nbsp;is a proprietary ad hoc service present in Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems, allowing users to transfer files between devices by making use of close-range wireless communication.   While this feature shows only receiver devices that are in users' contact lists by an authentication mechanism that compares an individual's phone number and email address with entrie

Critical RCE Bug Found in Homebrew Package Manager for macOS and Linux<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/critical-rce-bug-found-in-homebrew.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recently identified security vulnerability in the official Homebrew Cask repository could have been exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on users' machines that have Homebrew installed.  The issue, which was reported to the maintainers on April 18 by a Japanese security researcher named RyotaK, stemmed from the way code changes in its&nbsp; GitHub repository &nbsp;were handled, resulting in a scenario where a malicious&nbsp; pull request &nbsp;— i.e., the proposed changes — could be automatically reviewed and approved. The flaw was fixed on April 19.   Homebrew is a free and open-source software package manager solution that allows the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system as well as Linux. Homebrew&nbsp; Cask &nbsp;extends the functionality to include command-line workflows for GUI-based macOS applications, fonts, plugins, and other non-open source software.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new ransomware strain called " Qlocker " is targeting QNAP network attached storage (NAS) devices as part of an ongoing campaign and encrypting files in password-protected 7zip archives.  First reports of the&nbsp; infections &nbsp;emerged on April 20, with the adversaries behind the operations demanding a bitcoin payment (0.01 bitcoins or about $500.57) to receive the decryption key.  In response to the ongoing attacks, the Taiwanese company has released an advisory prompting users to apply updates to QNAP NAS running Multimedia Console, Media Streaming Add-on, and HBS 3 Hybrid Backup Sync to secure the devices from any attacks.   "QNAP strongly urges that all users immediately install the latest Malware Remover version and run a malware scan on QNAP NAS," the company&nbsp; said . "The Multimedia Console, Media Streaming Add-on, and Hybrid Backup Sync apps need to be updated to the latest available version as well to further secure QNAP NAS from ransomware attacks."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Thursday issued an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;warning of multiple vulnerabilities in the OpENer&nbsp; EtherNet/IP &nbsp;stack that could expose industrial systems to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, data leaks, and remote code execution.  All OpENer commits and versions prior to February 10, 2021, are affected, although there are no known public exploits that specifically target these vulnerabilities.  The four security flaws were discovered and reported to CISA by researchers Tal Keren and Sharon Brizinov from operational technology security company Claroty. Additionally, a fifth security issue identified by Claroty was previously disclosed by Cisco Talos ( CVE-2020-13556 ) on December 2, 2020.   "An attacker would only need to send crafted ENIP/CIP packets to the device in order to exploit these vulnerabilities," the researchers&nbsp; said .  CVE-2020-13556 concerns an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Ethernet/IP server that could

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple one-click vulnerabilities have been discovered across a variety of popular software applications, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on target systems.  The issues were discovered by Positive Security researchers Fabian Bräunlein and Lukas Euler and affect apps like Telegram, Nextcloud, VLC, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Bitcoin/Dogecoin Wallets, Wireshark, and Mumble.  "Desktop applications which pass user supplied URLs to be opened by the operating system are frequently vulnerable to code execution with user interaction," the researchers&nbsp; said . "Code execution can be achieved either when a URL pointing to a malicious executable (.desktop, .jar, .exe, …) hosted on an internet accessible file share (nfs, webdav, smb, …) is opened, or an additional vulnerability in the opened application's URI handler is exploited."   Put differently; the flaws stem from an insufficient validation of URL input that, when opened with the help of the u

New WhatsApp Bugs Could've Let Attackers Hack Your Phone Remotely<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/new-whatsapp-bug-couldve-let-attackers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook-owned WhatsApp recently addressed two security vulnerabilities in its messaging app for Android that could have been exploited to execute malicious code remotely on the device and even compromise encrypted communications.  The flaws take aim at devices running Android versions up to and including Android 9 by carrying out what's known as a "man-in-the-disk" attack that makes it possible for adversaries to compromise an app by manipulating certain data being exchanged between it and the external storage.  "The two aforementioned WhatsApp vulnerabilities would have made it possible for attackers to remotely collect TLS cryptographic material for TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2 sessions," researchers from Census Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;today.&nbsp;  "With the TLS secrets at hand, we will demonstrate how a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can lead to the compromise of WhatsApp communications, to remote code execution on the victim device and to the extraction of Noise protocol key

New JavaScript Exploit Can Now Carry Out DDR4 Rowhammer Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/new-javascript-exploit-can-now-carry.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Academics from Vrije University in Amsterdam and ETH Zurich have published a new research paper describing yet another variation of the Rowhammer attack.  Dubbed&nbsp; SMASH &nbsp;(Synchronized MAny-Sided Hammering), the technique can be used to successfully trigger the attack from JavaScript on modern DDR4 RAM cards, notwithstanding extensive mitigations that have been put in place by manufacturers over the last seven years.  "Despite their in-DRAM Target Row Refresh (TRR) mitigations, some of the most recent DDR4 modules are still vulnerable to many-sided Rowhammer bit flips," the researchers said.&nbsp;  "SMASH exploits high-level knowledge of cache replacement policies to generate optimal access patterns for eviction-based many-sided Rowhammer. To bypass the in-DRAM TRR mitigations, SMASH carefully schedules cache hits and misses to successfully trigger synchronized many-sided Rowhammer bit flips."   By synchronizing memory requests with DRAM refresh commands, the researchers

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday released a new version of Chrome web-browsing software for Windows, Mac, and Linux with patches for two newly discovered security vulnerabilities for both of which it says exploits exist in the wild, allowing attackers to engage in active exploitation.  One of the two flaws concerns an insufficient validation of untrusted input in its V8 JavaScript rendering engine (CVE-2021-21220), which was demonstrated by Dataflow Security's Bruno Keith and Niklas Baumstark at the&nbsp; Pwn2Own 2021 &nbsp;hacking contest last week.   While Google moved to fix the flaw quickly, security researcher Rajvardhan Agarwal published a&nbsp; working exploit &nbsp;over the weekend by reverse-engineering the patch that the Chromium team pushed to the open-source component, a factor that may have played a crucial role in the release.  UPDATE: &nbsp; Agarwal, in an email to The Hacker News, confirmed that there's one more vulnerability  affecting Chromium-based browsers that has been patched in the latest vers

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In its April slate of patches, Microsoft rolled out fixes for a total of&nbsp; 114 security flaws , including an actively exploited zero-day and four remote code execution bugs in Exchange Server.  Of the&nbsp; 114 flaws , 19 are rated as Critical, 88 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity.  Chief among them is&nbsp; CVE-2021-28310 , a privilege escalation vulnerability in Win32k that's said to be under active exploitation, allowing attackers to elevate privileges by running malicious code on a target system.&nbsp;  Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which discovered and reported the flaw to Microsoft in February, linked the zero-day exploit to a threat actor named Bitter APT, which was found exploiting a similar flaw ( CVE-2021-1732 ) in attacks late last year.   "It is an escalation of privilege (EoP) exploit that is likely used together with other browser exploits to escape sandboxes or get system privileges for further access," Kaspersky researcher Boris Larin&nbsp; said .

Security researchers have uncovered nine vulnerabilities affecting four TCP/IP stacks impacting more than 100 million consumer and enterprise devices that could be exploited by an attacker to take control of a vulnerable system.  Dubbed " NAME:WRECK " by Forescout and JSOF, the flaws are the latest in series of studies undertaken as part of an initiative called Project Memoria to study the security of widely-used TCP/IP stacks that are incorporated by various vendors in their firmware to offer internet and network connectivity features.  "These vulnerabilities relate to Domain Name System (DNS) implementations, causing either Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to take target devices offline or to take control over them," the researchers said.  The name comes from the fact that parsing of domain names can break (i.e., "wreck") DNS implementations in TCP/IP stacks, adding to a recent uptick in vulnerabilities such as

The 2021 spring edition of&nbsp; Pwn2Own &nbsp;hacking contest concluded last week on April 8 with a three-way tie between Team Devcore, OV, and Computest researchers Daan Keuper and Thijs Alkemade.  A total of $1.2 million was awarded for 16 high-profile exploits over the course of the three-day virtual event organized by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).  Targets with successful attempts included Zoom, Apple Safari, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Teams, Parallels Desktop, Windows 10, and Ubuntu Desktop operating systems.   Some of the major highlights are as follows —   Using an authentication bypass and a local privilege escalation to completely take over a Microsoft Exchange server, for which the Devcore team netted $200,000  Chaining a pair of bugs to achieve code execution in Microsoft Teams, earning researcher OV $200,000  A zero-click exploit targeting Zoom that employed a three-bug chain to exploit the messenger app and gain code execution on the target system.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Networking equipment major Cisco Systems has said it does not plan to fix a critical security vulnerability affecting some of its Small Business routers, instead urging users to replace the devices.  The bug, tracked as CVE-2021-1459, is rated with a CVSS score of  9.8 out of 10, and affects RV110W VPN firewall and Small Business RV130, RV130W, and RV215W routers, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected appliance.   The flaw, which stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface, could be exploited by a malicious actor to send specially-crafted HTTP requests to the targeted device and achieve remote code execution.  " A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the affected device," Cisco&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its advisory.   Security researcher Treck Zhou has been credited with reporting the vulnerability. Although

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday announced that its open source version of the Android operating system will add support for Rust programming language in a bid to prevent memory safety bugs.  To that end, the company has been building parts of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) with Rust for the past 18 months, with plans in the pipeline to scale this initiative to cover more aspects of the operating system.  "Managed languages like Java and Kotlin are the best option for Android app development," Google&nbsp; said . "The Android OS uses Java extensively, effectively protecting large portions of the Android platform from memory bugs. Unfortunately, for the lower layers of the OS, Java and Kotlin are not an option."   Stating that code written in C and C++ languages requires robust isolation when parsing untrustworthy input, Google said the technique of containing such code within a tightly constrained and unprivileged sandbox can be expensive, causing latency issues and additional

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber attackers are actively setting their sights on unsecured SAP applications in an attempt to steal information and sabotage critical processes, according to new research.  "Observed exploitation could lead in many cases to full control of the unsecured SAP application, bypassing common security and compliance controls, and enabling attackers to steal sensitive information, perform financial fraud or disrupt mission-critical business processes by deploying ransomware or stopping operations," cybersecurity firm Onapsis and SAP&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a joint report published today.  The Boston-based company said it detected over 300 successful exploitations out of a total of 1,500 attempts targeting previously known vulnerabilities and insecure configurations specific to SAP systems between mid-2020 to March 2021, with multiple brute-force attempts made by adversaries aimed at high-privilege SAP accounts as well as chaining together several flaws to strike SAP applications.

A novel technique adopted by attackers finds ways to use Microsoft's Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) so as to deploy malicious payloads on Windows machines stealthily.  In 2020, hospitals, retirement communities, and medical centers bore the brunt of an&nbsp; ever-shifting phishing campaign &nbsp;that distributed custom backdoors such as KEGTAP, which ultimately paved the way for RYUK ransomware attacks.  But new&nbsp; research &nbsp;by FireEye's Mandiant cyber forensics arm has now revealed a previously unknown persistence mechanism that shows the adversaries made use of BITS to launch the backdoor.   Introduced in Windows XP,&nbsp; BITS &nbsp;is a component of Microsoft Windows, which makes use of idle network bandwidth to facilitate the asynchronous transfer of files between machines. This is achieved by creating a job — a container that includes the files to download or upload.  BITS is commonly used to deliver operating system updates to clients as well as by Windows Defender antivirus

As many as five vulnerabilities have been uncovered in Ovarro's TBox remote terminal units (RTUs) that, if left unpatched, could open the door for escalating attacks against critical infrastructures, like remote code execution and denial-of-service.  "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in remote code execution, which may cause a denial-of-service condition," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published on March 23.  TBox is an "all-in-one" solution for automation and control systems for supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA ) applications, with its telemetry software used for remote control and monitoring of assets in a number of critical infrastructure sectors, such as water, power, oil and gas, transportation, and process industries.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed two new vulnerabilities in Linux-based operating systems that, if successfully exploited, could let attackers circumvent mitigations for speculative attacks such as&nbsp; Spectre &nbsp;and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.  Discovered by&nbsp; Piotr Krysiuk &nbsp;of Symantec's Threat Hunter team, the flaws — tracked as CVE-2020-27170 and CVE-2020-27171 (CVSS scores: 5.5) — impact all Linux kernels prior to 5.11.8. Patches for the security issues were released on March 20, with Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat deploying fixes for the vulnerabilities in their respective Linux distributions.  While&nbsp; CVE-2020-27170 &nbsp;can be abused to reveal content from any location within the kernel memory,&nbsp; CVE-2020-27171  can be used to retrieve data from a 4GB range of kernel memory.   First documented in January 2018,&nbsp; Spectre and Meltdown &nbsp;take advantage of flaws in modern processors to&nbsp; leak data &nbsp;that are currently processed on the computer, thereby allowing

Merely weeks after releasing out-of-band patches for iOS, iPadOS, macOS and watchOS, Apple has issued yet another security update for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch to fix a critical zero-day weakness that it says is being actively exploited in the wild.  Tracked as CVE-2021-1879 , the vulnerability relates to a WebKit flaw that could enable adversaries to process maliciously crafted web content that may result in universal cross-site scripting attacks.  "This issue was addressed by improved management of object lifetimes," the iPhone maker noted.  Apple has credited Clement Lecigne and Billy Leonard of Google's Threat Analysis Group for discovering and reporting the issue. While details of the flaw have not been disclosed, the company said it's aware of reports that CVE-2021-1879 may have been actively exploited.   Updates are available for the following devices:   iOS 12.5.2 &nbsp;- Phone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, and iPod touch (6t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The maintainers of OpenSSL have released a fix for two high-severity security flaws in its software that could be exploited to carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and bypass certificate verification.  Tracked as CVE-2021-3449  and CVE-2021-3450 , both the&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;have been resolved in an update (version OpenSSL 1.1.1k) released on Thursday. While CVE-2021-3449 affects all OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions, CVE-2021-3450 impacts OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer.  OpenSSL is a software library consisting of cryptographic functions that implement the Transport Layer Security protocol with the goal of securing communications sent over a computer network.   According to an advisory published by OpenSSL, CVE-2021-3449 concerns a potential DoS vulnerability arising due to NULL pointer dereferencing that can cause an OpenSSL TLS server to crash if in the course of renegotiation the client transmits a malicious "ClientHello" message during the&nbsp; handshake &nbsp;between the server and

New research into&nbsp; 5G architecture &nbsp;has uncovered a security flaw in its network slicing and virtualized network functions that could be exploited to allow data access and denial of service attacks between different network slices on a mobile operator's 5G network.  AdaptiveMobile shared its findings with the GSM Association (GSMA) on February 4, 2021, following which the weaknesses were collectively designated as CVD-2021-0047.  5G is an evolution of current 4G architectures and is based on what's called a service-based architecture (SBA) that provides a modular framework to deploy a set of interconnected network functions, allowing consumers to discover and authorize their access to a plethora of services.  The network functions are also responsible for registering subscribers, managing sessions and subscriber profiles, storing subscriber data, and connecting the users (UE or user equipment) to the internet via a base station (gNB).

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
IT infrastructure management provider SolarWinds on Thursday released a new update to its Orion networking monitoring tool with fixes for four security vulnerabilities, counting two weaknesses that could be exploited by an authenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE).  Chief among them is a JSON deserialization flaw that allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary code via the&nbsp; test alert actions &nbsp;feature available in the Orion Web Console, which lets users simulate network events (e.g., an unresponsive server) that can be configured to trigger an alert during setup. It has been rated critical in severity.   A second issue concerns a high-risk vulnerability that could be leveraged by an adversary to achieve RCE in the Orion Job Scheduler. "In order to exploit this, an attacker first needs to know the credentials of an unprivileged local account on the Orion Server," SolarWinds&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its release notes.  The advisory is light on technical specifics,

Cisco on Wednesday released software updates to address multiple vulnerabilities affecting its Jabber messaging clients across Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.  Successful exploitation of the flaws could permit an "attacker to execute arbitrary programs on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges, access sensitive information, intercept protected network traffic, or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition," the networking major&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory.  The issues concern a total of five security vulnerabilities, three of which (CVE-2021-1411, CVE-2021-1417, and CVE-2021-1418) were reported to the company by Olav Sortland Thoresen of Watchcom, with two others (CVE-2021-1469 and CVE-2021-1471) uncovered during internal security testing.   Cisco notes that the flaws are not dependent on one another, and that exploitation of any one of the vulnerabilities doesn't hinge on the exploitation of another. But in order to do this, an attacker needs to be authenti

Google has disclosed that a now-patched vulnerability affecting Android devices that use Qualcomm chipsets is being weaponized by attackers to launch targeted attacks.  Tracked as CVE-2020-11261  (CVSS score 8.4), the flaw concerns  an "improper input validation" issue in Qualcomm's Graphics component that could be exploited to trigger memory corruption when an attacker-engineered app requests access to a huge chunk of the device's memory.   "There are indications that CVE-2020-11261 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," the search giant said  in an updated January security bulletin on March 18.  CVE-2020-11261 was discovered and reported to Qualcomm by Google's Android Security team on July 20, 2020, after which it was fixed in January 2021.   It's worth noting that the access vector for the vulnerability is "local," meaning that exploitation requires local access to the device. In other words, to launch a successful attack, the b

Cybersecurity researchers on Sunday disclosed multiple critical vulnerabilities in remote student monitoring software Netop Vision Pro &nbsp;that a malicious attacker could abuse to execute arbitrary code and take over Windows computers.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Apache Software Foundation on Friday addressed a high severity vulnerability in Apache OFBiz that could have allowed an unauthenticated adversary to remotely seize control of the open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-26295 , the flaw affects all versions of the software prior to&nbsp; 17.12.06 &nbsp;and employs an "unsafe deserialization" as an attack vector to permit unauthorized remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server directly.   OFBiz &nbsp;is a Java-based web framework for automating enterprise processes and offers a wide range of functionality, including accounting, customer relationship management, manufacturing operations management, order management, supply chain fulfillment, and warehouse management system, among others.  Specifically, by exploiting this flaw, a malicious party can tamper with serialized data to insert arbitrary code that, when deserialized, can potentially result in remote code execution.

Critical F5 BIG-IP Bug Under Active Attacks After PoC Exploit Posted Online<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/latest-f5-big-ip-bug-under-active.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Almost 10 days after application security company F5 Networks&nbsp; released patches &nbsp;for critical vulnerabilities in its BIG-IP and BIG-IQ products, adversaries have begun opportunistically mass scanning and targeting exposed and unpatched networking devices to break into enterprise networks.  News of in the wild exploitation development comes on the heels of a proof-of-concept exploit code that surfaced online earlier this week by reverse-engineering the Java software patch in BIG-IP. The&nbsp; mass scans &nbsp;are said to have spiked since March 18.   The flaws affect BIG-IP versions 11.6 or 12.x and newer, with a critical remote code execution (CVE-2021-22986) also impacting BIG-IQ versions 6.x and 7.x.&nbsp; CVE-2021-22986 &nbsp;(CVSS score: 9.8) is notable for the fact that it's an unauthenticated, remote command execution vulnerability affecting the iControl REST interface, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, and disable services without the need for a

Critical RCE Flaw Reported in MyBB Forum Software—Patch Your Sites<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/critical-rce-flaw-reported-in-mybb.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A pair of critical vulnerabilities in a popular bulletin board software called MyBB could have been chained together to achieve remote code execution (RCE) without the need for prior access to a privileged account.  The flaws, which were discovered by independent security researchers Simon Scannell and Carl Smith, were reported to the MyBB Team on February 22, following which it&nbsp; released &nbsp;an update (version 1.8.26) on March 10 addressing the issues.  MyBB, formerly MyBBoard and originally MyBulletinBoard, is free and open-source forum software developed using PHP and MySQL.   According to the researchers, the first issue — a nested auto URL persistent XSS vulnerability (CVE-2021-27889) — stems from how MyBB parses messages containing URLs during the rendering process, thus enabling any unprivileged forum user to embed stored XSS payloads into threads, posts, and even private messages.

Why Cached Credentials Can Cause Account Lockouts and How to Stop it<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/why-cached-credentials-can-cause.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
When a user account becomes locked out, the cause is often attributed to a user who has simply entered an old or incorrect password too many times. However, this is far from being the only thing that can cause an account to become locked.  Another common cause, for example, is an application or script that is configured to log into the system using an old password. Perhaps the most easily overlooked cause of account lockouts, however, is the use of cached credentials.  Before I explain&nbsp; why cached credentials can be problematic , let's first consider what the Windows cached credentials do and why they are necessary.  Cached and stored credentials  Cached credentials are a mechanism that is used to ensure that users have a way of logging into their device in the event that the device is unable to access the Active Directory. Suppose for a moment that a user is working from a domain-joined laptop and is connected to the corporate network.  In that type of situation, the Active Directory

Flaws in Two Popular WordPress Plugins Affect Over 7 Million Websites<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/flaws-in-two-popular-wordpress-plugins.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed vulnerabilities in multiple WordPress plugins that, if successfully exploited, could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code and take over a website in certain scenarios.  The flaws were uncovered in&nbsp; Elementor , a website builder plugin used on more than seven million sites, and&nbsp; WP Super Cache , a tool used to serve cached pages of a WordPress site.  According to Wordfence, which discovered the security weaknesses in Elementor, the bug concerns a set of&nbsp; stored cross-site scripting &nbsp;(XSS) vulnerabilities (CVSS score: 6.4), which occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into a vulnerable web application.   In this case, due to a lack of validation of the HTML tags on the server-side, a bad actor can exploit the issues to add executable JavaScript to a post or page via a crafted request.  "Since posts created by contributors are typically reviewed by editors or administrators before publishing, any JavaScript added to one of these posts would

Application security company F5 Networks on Wednesday published an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;warning of four critical vulnerabilities impacting multiple products that could result in a denial of service (DoS) attack and even remote code execution on target networks.  The patches concern a total of seven related flaws (from CVE-2021-22986 through CVE-2021-22992),&nbsp; two &nbsp;of&nbsp; which &nbsp;were discovered and reported by Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero in December 2020.   The four critical flaws affect BIG-IP versions 11.6 or 12.x and newer, with CVE-2021-22986 also affecting BIG-IQ versions 6.x and 7.x. F5 said it's not aware of any public exploitation of these issues.  Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a full compromise of vulnerable systems, including the possibility of remote code execution as well as trigger a buffer overflow, leading to a DoS attack.  Urging customers to update their BIG-IP and BIG-IQ deployments to a fixed version as soon as possible, F5 Networks

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has awarded an independent security researcher $50,000 as part of its bug bounty program for reporting a flaw that could have allowed a malicious actor to hijack users' accounts without their knowledge.  Reported by Laxman Muthiyah, the vulnerability aims to brute-force the seven-digit security code that's sent to a user's email address or mobile number to corroborate his (or her) identity before resetting the password in order to recover access to the account.  Put differently, the account takeover scenario is a consequence of privilege escalation stemming from an authentication bypass at an endpoint which is used to verify the codes sent as part of the&nbsp; account recovery process .  The company addressed the issue in November 2020, before details of the flaw came to light on Tuesday.   Although there are encryption barriers and rate-limiting checks designed to prevent an attacker from repeatedly submitting all the 10 million combinations of the codes in an automa

New 'unc0ver' Tool Can Jailbreak All iPhone Models Running iOS 11.0 - 14.3<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/new-unc0ver-tool-can-jailbreak-all.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A popular jailbreaking tool called "unc0ver" has been updated to support iOS 14.3 and earlier releases, thereby making it possible to unlock almost every single iPhone model using a vulnerability that Apple in January disclosed was actively exploited in the wild.  The latest release, dubbed unc0ver v6.0.0, was&nbsp; released &nbsp;on Sunday, according to its lead developer Pwn20wnd, expanding its compatibility to jailbreak any device running iOS 11.0 through iOS 14.3 using a kernel vulnerability, including iOS 12.4.9-12.5.1, 13.5.1-13.7, and 14.0-14.3.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-1782 , the flaw is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the kernel stemming from a race condition that could cause a malicious application to elevate its privileges.   "We wrote our own exploit based on CVE-2021-1782 for #unc0ver to achieve optimal exploit speed and stability," Pwn20wnd&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a separate tweet.  The vulnerability has since been addressed by Apple as part of its iOS and iPadOS 14.4 u

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have uncovered gaps in Amazon's skill vetting process for the Alexa voice assistant ecosystem that could allow a malicious actor to publish a deceptive skill under any arbitrary developer name and even make backend code changes after approval to trick users into giving up sensitive information.  The findings were presented on Wednesday at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) conference by a group of academics from Ruhr-Universität Bochum and the North Carolina State University, who analyzed 90,194 skills available in seven countries, including the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and France.  Amazon Alexa allows third-party developers to create additional functionality for devices such as Echo smart speakers by configuring "skills" that run on top of the voice assistant, thereby making it easy for users to initiate a conversation with the skill and complete a specific task.&nbsp;   Chief among the findings is the concern that

Cisco has addressed a maximum severity vulnerability in its Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Multi-Site Orchestrator (MSO) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication on vulnerable devices.  "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the affected API," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory published yesterday. "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to receive a token with administrator-level privileges that could be used to authenticate to the API on affected MSO and managed Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices."  The bug, tracked as CVE-2021-1388, ranks 10 (out of 10) on the CVSS vulnerability scoring system and stems from an improper token validation in an API endpoint of Cisco ACI MSO installed the Application Services Engine. It affects ACI MSO versions running a 3.0 release of the software.   The ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator lets customers monitor and m

"A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in its advisory.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-21972, has a CVSS score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10, making it critical in severity.   "In our opinion, the RCE vulnerability in the vCenter Server can pose no less a threat than the infamous vulnerability in Citrix (CVE-2019-19781)," said Positive Technologies' Mikhail Klyuchnikov, who discovered and reported the flaw to VMware.  "The error allows an unauthorized user to send a specially crafted request, which will later give them the opportunity

A severe security vulnerability in a popular video calling software development kit (SDK) could have allowed an attacker to spy on ongoing private video and audio calls.  That's according to new research published  by the McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) team today, which found the aforementioned flaw in Agora.io's SDK used by several social apps such as eHarmony, Plenty of Fish, MeetMe, and Skout; healthcare apps like Talkspace, Practo, and Dr. First's Backline; and in the Android app that's paired with "temi" personal robot.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malvertising group known as "ScamClub" exploited a zero-day vulnerability in WebKit-based browsers to inject malicious payloads that redirected users to fraudulent websites gift card scams.  The attacks, first spotted  by ad security firm Confiant in late June 2020, leveraged a bug (CVE-2021–1801) that allowed malicious parties to bypass the iframe  sandboxing policy in the browser engine that powers Safari and Google Chrome for iOS and run malicious code.   Specifically, the technique exploited the manner how WebKit handles JavaScript event listeners , thus making it possible to break out of the sandbox associated with an ad's inline frame element despite the presence of "allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" attribute that explicitly forbids any redirection unless the click event occurs inside the iframe.  To test this hypothesis, the researchers set about creating a simple HTML file containing a cross-origin sandboxed iframe and a button outside it that

Unpatched ShareIT Android App Flaw Could Let Hackers Inject Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/unpatched-shareit-android-app-flaw.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple unpatched vulnerabilities have been discovered in SHAREit , a popular app with over one billion downloads, that could be abused to leak a user's sensitive data, execute arbitrary code, and possibly lead to remote code execution.  The findings come from cybersecurity firm Trend Micro's analysis of the Android version of the app, which allows users to share or transfer files between devices.  But in a worrisome twist, the flaws are yet to be patched by Smart Media4U Technology Pte. Ltd., the Singapore-based developer of the app, despite responsible disclosure three months ago.  "We decided to disclose our research three months after reporting this since many users might be affected by this attack because the attacker can steal sensitive data and do anything with the apps' permission," Trend Micro researcher Echo Duan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up. "It is also not easily detectable."   One of the flaws arises from the manner the app facilitates sharing of

A Sticker Sent On Telegram Could Have Exposed Your Secret Chats<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/a-sticker-sent-on-telegram-could-have.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed details of a now-patched flaw in the Telegram messaging app that could have exposed users' secret messages, photos, and videos to remote malicious actors.  The issues were discovered by Italy-based Shielder in iOS, Android, and macOS versions of the app. Following responsible disclosure, Telegram addressed them in a series of patches on September 30 and October 2, 2020.  The flaws stemmed from the way secret chat functionality operates and in the app's handling of&nbsp; animated stickers , thus allowing attackers to send malformed stickers to unsuspecting users and gain access to messages, photos, and videos that were exchanged with their Telegram contacts through both classic and secret chats.   One caveat of note is that exploiting the flaws in the wild may not have been trivial, as it requires chaining the aforementioned weaknesses to at least one additional vulnerability in order to get around security defenses in modern devices tod

Secret Chat in Telegram Left Self-Destructing Media Files On Devices<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/secret-chat-in-telegram-left-self.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular messaging app Telegram fixed a privacy-defeating bug in its macOS app that made it possible to access self-destructing audio and video messages long after they disappeared from secret chats.  The vulnerability was&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;by security researcher Dhiraj Mishra in version 7.3 of the app, who disclosed his findings to Telegram on December 26, 2020. The issue has since been resolved in&nbsp; version 7.4 , released on January 29.  Unlike Signal or WhatsApp, conversations on Telegram by default are not end-to-end encrypted, unless users explicitly opt to enable a device-specific feature called " secret chat ," which keeps data encrypted even on Telegram servers. Also available as part of secret chats is the option to send self-destructing messages.   What Mishra found was that when a user records and sends an audio or video message via a regular chat, the application leaked the exact path where the recorded message is stored in ".mp4" format. With the secret chat

Apple Patches 10-Year-Old macOS SUDO Root Privilege Escalation Bug<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/apple-patches-10-year-old-macos-sudo.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple has rolled out a fix for a critical sudo vulnerability in macOS Big Sur, Catalina, and Mojave that could allow unauthenticated local users to gain root-level privileges on the system.  "A local attacker may be able to elevate their privileges," Apple&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a security advisory. "This issue was addressed by updating to sudo version 1.9.5p2."  Sudo is a common utility built into most Unix and Linux operating systems that lets a user without security privileges access and run a program with the credentials of another user.  Tracked as CVE-2021-3156  (also called " Baron Samedit "), the vulnerability first came to light last month after security auditing firm Qualys&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;the existence of a heap-based buffer overflow, which it said had been "hiding in plain sight" for almost 10 years.   The vulnerability, which was introduced in the code back in July 2011, impacts sudo versions 1.7.7 through 1.7.10p9, 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2, and 1.9.0

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cisco has rolled out fixes for multiple critical vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Small Business routers that could potentially allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on an affected device.  The&nbsp; flaws &nbsp;— tracked from CVE-2021-1289 through CVE-2021-1295 (CVSS score 9.8) — impact RV160, RV160W, RV260, RV260P, and RV260W VPN routers running a firmware release earlier than Release 1.0.01.02.  Along with the aforementioned three vulnerabilities, patches have also been released for two more&nbsp; arbitrary file write flaws &nbsp;(CVE-2021-1296 and CVE-2021-1297) affecting the same set of VPN routers that could have made it possible for an adversary to overwrite arbitrary files on the vulnerable system.   All the nine security issues were reported to the networking equipment maker by security researcher Takeshi Shiomitsu, who has previously uncovered&nbsp; similar critical flaws &nbsp;in RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W Routers that could be lever

Google has patched a zero-day vulnerability in Chrome web browser for desktop that it says is being actively exploited in the wild.  The company released&nbsp; 88.0.4324.150 &nbsp;for Windows, Mac, and Linux, with a fix for a heap buffer overflow flaw (CVE-2021-21148) in its V8 JavaScript rendering engine.

Previously on February 2, Google&nbsp; addressed six issues in Chrome , including one critical use after free vulnerability in Payments (CVE-2021-21142) and four high severity issues in Extensions, Tab Groups, Fonts, and Navigation features.  While it's typical of Google to limit details of the vulnerability until a majority of users are updated with the fix, the development comes weeks after Google and Microsoft&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;attacks carried out by North Korean hackers against security resear

Major vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi module that could have been exploited to gain root access and take complete control of a device's wireless communications.  The six flaws were&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by researchers from Israeli IoT security firm Vdoo.  The&nbsp; Realtek RTL8195A &nbsp;module is a standalone, low-power-consumption Wi-Fi hardware module targeted at embedded devices used in several industries such as agriculture, smart home, healthcare, gaming, and automotive sectors.  It also makes use of an "Ameba" API, allowing developers to communicate with the device via Wi-Fi, HTTP, and&nbsp; MQTT , a lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices.   Although the issues uncovered by Vdoo were verified only on RTL8195A, the researchers said they extend to other modules as well, including RTL8711AM, RTL8711AF, and RTL8710AF.  The flaws concern a mix of stack overflow, and out-of-bounds reads that stem from the Wi-Fi module's WPA2&nbsp; fo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed three severe security vulnerabilities impacting SolarWinds products, the most severe of which could have been exploited to achieve remote code execution with elevated privileges.  Two of the flaws (CVE-2021-25274 and CVE-2021-25275) were identified in the SolarWinds Orion Platform, while a third separate weakness (CVE-2021-25276) was found in the company's Serv-U FTP server for Windows,&nbsp; said &nbsp;cybersecurity firm Trustwave in technical analysis.  None of the three security issues have been exploited in the unprecedented&nbsp; supply chain attack &nbsp;targeting the Orion Platform that came to light last December.   The two sets of vulnerabilities in Orion and Serv-U FTP were disclosed to SolarWinds on December 30, 2020, and January 4, 2021, respectively, following which the company resolved the issues on January 22 and January 25.  It's highly recommended that users install the latest versions of&nbsp; Orion Platform &nbsp;and Serv-U FTP ( 15.2.2 Ho

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A "severe" vulnerability in GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG)'s Libgcrypt encryption software&nbsp;could have allowed an attacker to write arbitrary data to the target machine, potentially leading to remote code execution.  The flaw, which affects version 1.9.0 of libgcrypt, was discovered on January 28 by Tavis Ormandy of Project Zero, a security research unit within Google dedicated to finding zero-day bugs in hardware and software systems.  No other versions of Libgcrypt are affected by the vulnerability.  "There is a&nbsp; heap buffer overflow &nbsp;in libgcrypt due to an incorrect assumption in the block buffer management code," Ormandy&nbsp; said . "Just decrypting some data can overflow a heap buffer with attacker controlled data, no verification or signature is validated before the vulnerability occurs."   GnuPG addressed the weakness almost immediately within a day after disclosure, while urging users to&nbsp; stop using &nbsp;the vulnerable version. The latest version can be dow

New Docker Container Escape Bug Affects Microsoft Azure Functions<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/new-docker-container-escape-bug-affects.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed an unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft Azure Functions that could be used by an attacker to escalate privileges and escape the Docker container used for hosting them.  The findings come as part of Intezer Lab 's investigations into the Azure compute infrastructure.  Following disclosure to Microsoft, the Windows maker is said to have "determined that the vulnerability has no security impact on Function users, since the host itself is still protected by another defense boundary against the elevated position we reached in the container host."   Azure Functions , analogous to Amazon AWS Lambda, is a serverless solution that allows users to run event-triggered code without having to provision or manage infrastructure explicitly while simultaneously making it possible to scale and allocate compute and resources based on demand.  By incorporating Docker into the mix, it makes it possible for developers to easily deploy and run Azure F

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Newly discovered security vulnerabilities in ADT's Blue (formerly LifeShield) home security cameras could have been exploited to hijack both audio and video streams.  The&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;(tracked as CVE-2020-8101) were identified in the video doorbell camera by Bitdefender researchers in February 2020 before they were eventually addressed on August 17, 2020.  LifeShield was acquired by Florida-based ADT Inc. in 2019, with Lifeshield's DIY home security solutions rebranded as Blue as of January 2020. The company's products had a 33.6% market share in the U.S. last year.   The security issues in the doorbell camera allow an attacker to   Obtain the administrator password of the camera by simply knowing its MAC address, which is used to identify a device uniquely  Inject commands locally to gain root access, and  Access audio and video feeds using an unprotected&nbsp; RTSP &nbsp;(Real-Time Streaming Protocol) server   The doorbell is designed to periodically send heartbeat messages t

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple on Tuesday released updates for iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS with fixes for three security vulnerabilities that it says may have been actively exploited in the wild.  Reported by an anonymous researcher, the three&nbsp; zero-day &nbsp; flaws &nbsp;— CVE-2021-1782, CVE-2021-1870, and CVE-2021-1871 — could have allowed an attacker to elevate privileges and achieve remote code execution.  The iPhone maker did not disclose how widespread the attack was or reveal the identities of the attackers actively exploiting them.   While the privilege escalation bug in the kernel (CVE-2021-1782) was noted as a race condition that could cause a malicious application to elevate its privileges, the other two shortcomings — dubbed a "logic issue" — were discovered in the WebKit browser engine (CVE-2021-1870 and CVE-2021-1871), permitting an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution inside Safari.  Apple said the race condition and the WebKit flaws were addressed with improved locking and restrictions, resp

Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed a now-patched security flaw in TikTok that could have potentially enabled an attacker to build a database of the app's users and their associated phone numbers for future malicious activity.  Although this flaw only impacts those users who have linked a phone number with their account or logged in with a phone number, successful exploitation of the vulnerability could have resulted in data leakage and privacy violation, Check Point Research said in an analysis  shared with The Hacker News.  TikTok has deployed a fix to address the shortcoming following responsible disclosure from Check Point researchers.   The newly discovered bug resides in TikTok's " Find friends " feature that allows users to sync their contacts with the service to identify potential people to follow.  The contacts are uploaded to TikTok via an HTTP request in the form of a list that consists of hashed contact names and the corresponding phone numbers

More details have emerged about a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows NT LAN Manager ( NTLM ) that was addressed by Microsoft as part of its monthly&nbsp; Patch Tuesday updates &nbsp;earlier this month.  The flaw, tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-1678 &nbsp;(CVSS score 4.3), was described as a "remotely exploitable" flaw found in a vulnerable component bound to the network stack, although exact details of the flaw remained unknown.  Now according to researchers from Crowdstrike, the security bug, if left unpatched, could allow a bad actor to achieve remote code execution via an NTLM relay.   "This vulnerability allows an attacker to relay NTLM authentication sessions to an attacked machine, and use a printer spooler&nbsp; MSRPC &nbsp;interface to remotely execute code on the attacked machine," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday advisory.

Amazon has addressed a number of flaws in its Kindle e-reader platform that could have allowed an attacker to take control of victims' devices by simply sending them a malicious e-book.  Dubbed " KindleDrip ," the exploit chain takes advantage of a feature called " Send to Kindle " to send a malware-laced document to a Kindle device that, when opened, could be leveraged to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device and make unauthorized purchases.  "The code runs as root, and the attacker only needs to know the email address assigned to the victim's device,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Yogev Bar-On, a security researcher for Readlmode Labs, in a technical write-up on Thursday.  The first vulnerability lets a bad actor send an e-book to a Kindle, the second flaw allows for remote code execution while the e-book is parsed, and a third issue makes it possible to escalate privileges and run the code as the "root" user.   When linked together, these weaknesses

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In January 2019, a&nbsp; critical flaw &nbsp;was reported in Apple's FaceTime group chats feature that made it possible for users to initiate a FaceTime video call and eavesdrop on targets by adding their own number as a third person in a group chat even before the person on the other end accepted the incoming call.  The vulnerability was deemed so severe that the iPhone maker removed the FaceTime group chats feature altogether before the issue was resolved in a subsequent iOS update.  Since then, a number of similar shortcomings have been discovered in multiple video chat apps such as Signal, JioChat, Mocha, Google Duo, and Facebook Messenger — all thanks to the work of Google Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich.  "While [the Group FaceTime] bug was soon fixed, the fact that such a serious and easy to reach vulnerability had occurred due to a logic bug in a calling state machine — an attack scenario I had never seen considered on any platform — made me wonder whether other sta

"Our attack allows for poisoning of multiple domain names at once, and is a result of several vulnerabilities found.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google has patched a bug in its feedback tool incorporated across its services that could be exploited by an attacker to potentially steal screenshots of sensitive Google Docs documents simply by embedding them in a malicious website.  The flaw was discovered on July 9 by security researcher&nbsp; Sreeram KL , for which he was awarded $3133.70 as part of Google's Vulnerability Reward Program.   Many of Google's products, including Google Docs, come with a " Send feedback " or "Help Docs improve" option that allows users to send feedback along with an option to include a screenshot — something that's automatically loaded to highlight specific issues.  But instead of having to duplicate the same functionality across its services, the feedback feature is deployed in Google's main website ("www.google.com") and integrated to other domains via an iframe element that loads the pop-up's content from "feedback.googleusercontent.com."

Google's Project Zero team has made public details of an improperly patched zero-day security vulnerability in Windows print spooler API that could be leveraged by a bad actor to execute arbitrary code.  Details of the flaw were revealed after Microsoft failed to patch it within 90 days of responsible disclosure on September 24.  Originally tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2020-0986 , the flaw concerns an elevation of privilege exploits in the GDI Print /&nbsp; Print Spooler &nbsp;API ("splwow64.exe") that was reported to Microsoft by an anonymous user working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) back in late December 2019.   But with no patch in sight for about six months, ZDI ended up posting a public&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;as a zero-day on May 19 earlier this year, after which it was&nbsp; exploited &nbsp;in the wild in a campaign dubbed " Operation PowerFall " against an unnamed South Korean company.

The US Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) has&nbsp; warned &nbsp;of critical vulnerabilities in a low-level TCP/IP software library developed by Treck that, if weaponized, could allow remote attackers to run arbitrary commands and mount denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  The four flaws affect Treck TCP/IP stack version 6.0.1.67 and earlier and were reported to the company by Intel. Two of these are rated critical in severity.  Treck's embedded TCP/IP stack is deployed worldwide in manufacturing, information technology, healthcare, and transportation systems.   The most severe of them is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability ( CVE-2020-25066 ) in the Treck HTTP Server component that could permit an adversary to crash or reset the target device and even execute remote code. It has a CVSS score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10.  The second flaw is an out-of-bounds write in the IPv6 component ( CVE-2020-27337 , CVSS score 9.1) that could be exploited by an unauthenticated

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A team of researchers today unveils two critical security vulnerabilities it discovered in Dell Wyse Thin clients that could have potentially allowed attackers to remotely execute malicious code and access arbitrary files on affected devices.  The flaws, which were uncovered  by healthcare cybersecurity provider CyberMDX and reported to Dell in June 2020, affects all devices running ThinOS versions 8.6 and below.  Dell has addressed both the vulnerabilities in an&nbsp; update &nbsp;released today. The flaws also have a CVSS score of 10 out of 10, making them critical in severity.  Thin clients are typically computers that run from resources stored on a central server instead of a localized hard drive. They work by establishing a remote connection to the server, which takes care of launching and running applications and storing relevant data.  Tracked as CVE-2020-29491  and CVE-2020-29492 , the security shortcomings in Wyse's thin clients stem from the fact that the FTP sessions used to pull

Common Security Misconfigurations and Their Consequences<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/common-security-misconfigurations-and.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Everyone makes mistakes. That one sentence was drummed into me in my very first job in tech, and it has held true since then. In the cybersecurity world, misconfigurations can create exploitable issues that can haunt us later - so let's look at a few common security misconfigurations.  The first one is development permissions that don't get changed when something goes live. For example, AWS S3 buckets are often assigned permissive access while development is going on. The issues arise when security reviews aren't carefully performed prior to pushing the code live, no matter if that push is for the initial launch of a platform or for updates.  The result is straight-forward; a bucket goes live with the ability for anyone to read and write to and from it. This particular misconfiguration is dangerous; since the application is working and the site is loading for users, there's no visible indication that something is wrong until a threat actor hunting for open buckets stum
