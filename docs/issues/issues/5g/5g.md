Inadequate implementation of telecom standards, supply chain threats, and weaknesses in systems architecture could pose major cybersecurity risks to 5G networks, potentially making them a lucrative target for cybercriminals and nation-state adversaries to exploit for valuable intelligence.  The analysis, which aims to identify and assess risks and vulnerabilities introduced by 5G adoption, was published on Monday by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), in partnership with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  "As new 5G policies and standards are released, there remains the potential for threats that impact the end-user," the report&nbsp; said . "For example, nation states may attempt to exert undue influence on standards that benefit their proprietary technologies and limit customers' choices to use other equipment or software."   S

As 5G networks are being gradually rolled out in major cities across the world, an analysis of its network architecture has revealed a number of potential weaknesses that could be exploited to carry out a slew of cyber assaults, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks to deprive subscribers of Internet access and intercept data traffic.  The findings form the basis of a new " 5G Standalone core security research " published by London-based cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies today, exactly six months after the firm released its " Vulnerabilities in LTE and 5G Networks 2020 " report in June detailing high impact flaws in LTE and 5G protocols.  "Key elements of network security include proper configuration of equipment, as well as authentication and authorization of network elements," Positive Technologies said.   "In the absence of these elements, the network becomes vulnerable [to] subscriber denial of service due to exploitation of vulnerabil
