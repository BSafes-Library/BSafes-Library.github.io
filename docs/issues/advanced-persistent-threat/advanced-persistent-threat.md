APT Hackers Distributed Android Trojan via Syrian e-Government Portal<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/apt-hackers-distributed-android-trojan.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor has been tracked in a new campaign deploying Android malware via the Syrian e-Government Web Portal, indicating an upgraded arsenal designed to compromise victims.  "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the group has been publicly observed using malicious Android applications as part of its attacks," Trend Micro researchers Zhengyu Dong, Fyodor Yarochkin, and Steven Du&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up published Wednesday.  StrongPity , also codenamed&nbsp; Promethium &nbsp;by Microsoft, is believed to have been active since 2012 and has typically focused on targets across Turkey and Syria. In June 2020, the espionage threat actor was&nbsp; connected &nbsp;to a wave of activities that banked on watering hole attacks and tampered installers, which abuse the popularity of legitimate applications, to infect targets with malware.   "Promethium has been resilient over the years," Cisco Talos&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;last year. "Its campai

The Definitive RFP Templates for EDR/EPP and APT Protection<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2019/09/rfp-templates-for-edr-epp.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Advanced Persistent Threats groups were once considered a problem that concerns Fortune 100 companies only. However, the threat landscape of the recent years tells otherwise—in fact, every organization, regardless of vertical and size is at risk, whether as a direct target, supply chain or collateral damage.   The vast majority of security decision-makers acknowledge they need to address the APT risk with additional security solutions but struggle with mapping APT attack vectors to a clear-cut set of security product capabilities, which impairs their ability to choose the products that would best protect them.   Cynet is now addressing this need with the definitive RFP templates for EDR/EPP and APT Protection , an expert-made security requirement list, that enables stakeholders to accelerate and optimize the evaluation process of the products they evaluate.   These RFP templates aim to capture the widest common denominator in terms of security needs and deliver the essential that are

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malicious campaign that has set its sights on industrial-related entities in the Middle East since 2019 has resurfaced with an upgraded malware toolset to strike both Windows and macOS operating systems, symbolizing an expansion in both its targets and its strategy around distributing threats.  Russian cybersecurity firm attributed the attacks to an advanced persistent threat (APT) it tracks as " WildPressure ," with victims believed to be in the oil and gas industry.&nbsp;  WildPressure first came to light in March 2020 based off of a malware operation distributing a fully-featured C++ Trojan dubbed "Milum" that enabled the threat actor to gain remote control of the compromised device. The attacks were said to have begun as early as August 2019.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers are warning of ongoing attacks coordinated by a suspected Chinese-speaking threat actor targeting the Afghanistan government as part of an espionage campaign that may have had its provenance as far back as 2014.  Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point Research attributed the intrusions to a hacking group tracked under the moniker "IndigoZebra," with past activity aimed at other central-Asian countries, including Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.  "The threat actors behind the espionage leveraged Dropbox, the popular cloud-storage service, to infiltrate the Afghan National Security Council (NSC)," the researchers said in a technical write-up  shared with The Hacker News, adding they "orchestrated a ministry-to-ministry style deception, where an email is sent to a high-profile target from the mailboxes of another high-profile victim."

Cryptocurrency miners are typically associated with cybercriminal operations, not sophisticated nation state actor activity. They are not the most sophisticated type of threats, which also means that they are not among the most critical security issues that defenders address with urgency. Recent campaigns from the nation-state actor BISMUTH take advantage of the low-priority alerts coin miners cause to try and fly under the radar and establish persistence.
