An unpatched design flaw in the implementation of Microsoft Exchange's Autodiscover protocol has resulted in the leak of approximately 100,000 login names and passwords for Windows domains worldwide.  "This is a severe security issue, since if an attacker can control such domains or has the ability to 'sniff' traffic in the same network, they can capture domain credentials in plain text (HTTP basic authentication) that are being transferred over the wire," Guardicore's Amit Serper&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical report.  "Moreover, if the attacker has DNS-poisoning capabilities on a large scale (such as a nation-state attacker), they could systematically syphon out leaky passwords through a large-scale DNS poisoning campaign based on these Autodiscover TLDs [top-level domains]."   The Exchange&nbsp; Autodiscover &nbsp;service enables users to configure applications such as Microsoft Outlook with minimal user input, allowing just a combination of email addresses and pas

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
More than one terabyte of data containing 5.5 million files has been left exposed, leaking personal information of over 100,000 customers of a Colombian real estate firm, according to cybersecurity company WizCase.  The breach was discovered by Ata Hakçıl and his team in a database owned by Coninsa Ramon  H, a company that specializes in architecture, engineering, construction, and real estate services. "There was no need for a password or login credentials to see this information, and the data was not encrypted," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an exclusive report shared with The Hacker News.   The data exposure is the result of a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, causing sensitive information such as clients' names, photos, and addresses to be disclosed. The details stored in the bucket range from invoices and income documents to quotes and account statements dating between 2014 and 2021. The complete list of information contained in

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In yet another instance of software supply chain attack, unidentified hackers breached the website of&nbsp; MonPass , one of Mongolia's major certificate authorities, to backdoor its installer software with Cobalt Strike binaries.  The trojanized client was available for download between February 8, 2021, and March 3, 2021, said Czech cybersecurity software company Avast in a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published Thursday.  In addition, a public webserver hosted by MonPass was infiltrated potentially as many as eight separate times, with the researchers uncovering eight different web shells and backdoors on the compromised server.   Avast's investigation into the incident began after it discovered the backdoored installer and the implant on one of its customers' systems.

India's flag carrier airline, Air India, has&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a data breach affecting 4.5 million of its customers over a period stretching nearly 10 years after its Passenger Service System (PSS) provider SITA fell victim to a cyber attack earlier this year.  The breach involves personal data registered between Aug. 26, 2011 and Feb. 3, 2021, including details such as names, dates of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance, and Air India frequent flyer data as well as credit card data. But Air India said neither CVV/CVC numbers associated with the credit cards nor passwords were affected.   The airline had previously&nbsp; acknowledged &nbsp;the breach on March 19, stating that "its Passenger Service System provider has informed about a sophisticated cyber attack it was subjected to in the last week of February 2021."  In March, Swiss aviation information technology company SITA&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;it suffered a "highly sophisticated attack&amp;quo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Misconfigurations in multiple Android apps leaked sensitive data of more than 100 million users, potentially making them a lucrative target for malicious actors.  "By not following best-practices when configuring and integrating third-party cloud-services into applications, millions of users' private data was exposed," Check Point researchers said in an analysis published today and shared with The Hacker News.  "In some cases, this type of misuse only affects the users, however, the developers were also left vulnerable. The misconfigurations put users' personal data and developer's internal resources, such as access to update mechanisms, storage, and more at risk."  The findings come from a study of 23 Android applications available in the official Google Play Store, some of which have downloads ranging from 10,000 to 10 million, such as Astro Guru , iFax, Logo Maker , Screen Recorder , and T'Leva .

On April 15, software auditing startup Codecov alerted customers that its Bash Uploader utility had been infected with a backdoor as early as January 31 by unknown parties to gain access to authentication tokens for various internal software accounts used by developers.

Most mobile app users tend to blindly trust that the apps they download from app stores are safe and secure. But that isn't always the case.  To demonstrate the pitfalls and identify vulnerabilities on a large scale, cybersecurity and machine intelligence company CloudSEK recently provided a platform called&nbsp; BeVigil &nbsp;where individuals can search and check app security ratings and other security issues before installing an app.  A latest&nbsp; report &nbsp;shared with The Hacker News detailed how the BeVigil search engine identified over 40 apps - with more than a cumulative 100 million downloads - that had hardcoded private Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys embedded within them, putting their internal networks and their users' data at risk of cyberattacks.  BeVigil finds popular apps leaking AWS keys  The AWS key leakage was spotted in some of the major apps such as Adobe Photoshop Fix, Adobe Comp, Hootsuite, IBM's Weather Channel, and online shopping services Club Factory and Wholee.

3.2 Billion Leaked Passwords Contain 1.5 Million Records with Government Emails<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/32-billion-leaked-passwords-contain-15.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A staggering number of 3.28 billion passwords linked to 2.18 billion unique email addresses were exposed in what's one of the largest data dumps of breached usernames and passwords.  In addition, the leak includes 1,502,909 passwords associated with email addresses from government domains across the world, with the U.S. government alone taking up 625,505 of the exposed passwords, followed by the U.K (205,099), Australia (136,025), Brazil (68,535), and Canada (50,726).  The findings come from an analysis of a massive 100GB data set called "COMB21" — aka Compilation of Many Breaches — that was published for free in an online cybercrime forum earlier this February by putting together data from multiple leaks in different companies and organizations that occurred over the years.   It's worth noting that a leak doesn't imply a breach of public administration systems. The passwords are said to have been obtained via techniques such as password hash cracking after being

Click Studios, the Australian software company behind the Passwordstate  password management application, has notified customers to reset their passwords following a supply chain attack.  The Adelaide-based firm said a bad actor used sophisticated techniques to compromise the software's update mechanism and used it to drop malware on user computers.  The breach is said to have occurred between April 20, 8:33 PM UTC, and April 22, 0:30 AM UTC, for a total period of about 28 hours.  "Only customers that performed In-Place Upgrades between the times stated above are believed to be affected," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an advisory. "Manual Upgrades of Passwordstate are not compromised. Affected customers password records may have been harvested."   The development was first reported by the Polish tech news site&nbsp; Niebezpiecznik . It's not immediately clear who the attackers are or how they compromised the password manager's update feature.

An ongoing malvertising campaign tracked as "Tag Barnakle" has been behind the breach of more than 120 ad servers over the past year to sneakily inject code in an attempt to serve malicious advertisements that redirect users to rogue websites, thus exposing victims to scamware or malware.  Unlike other operators who set about their task by infiltrating the ad-tech ecosystem using "convincing personas" to buy space on legitimate websites for running the malicious ads, Tag Barnakle is "able to bypass this initial hurdle completely by going straight for the jugular — mass compromise of ad serving infrastructure,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Confiant security researcher Eliya Stein in a Monday write-up.   The development follows a year after the Tag Barnakle actor was found to have&nbsp; compromised nearly 60 ad servers &nbsp;in April 2020, with the infections primarily targeting an open-source advertising server called Revive.  The latest slew of attacks is no different, although the adve

In what's likely to be a goldmine for bad actors, personal information associated with approximately 533 million Facebook users worldwide has been leaked on a popular cybercrime forum for free—which was harvested by hackers in 2019 using a Facebook vulnerability.  The&nbsp; leaked data &nbsp;includes full names, Facebook IDs, mobile numbers, locations, email addresses, gender, occupation, city, country, marital status broken, account creation date, and other profile details down by country, with over 32 million records belonging to users in the U.S., 11 million users the U.K., and six million users in India, among others.   In total, the data being offered includes user information from 106 countries. Additionally, the data seems to have been obtained by exploiting a vulnerability that enabled automated scripts to scrape Facebook users' public profiles and associated private phone numbers en masse. The flaw has since been fixed by Facebook.    "This is old data that was previously

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular Indian mobile payments service MobiKwik  on Monday came under fire after 8.2 terabytes (TB) of data belonging to millions of its users began circulating on the dark web in the aftermath of a major data breach that came to light earlier this month.  The leaked data includes sensitive personal information such as: customer names, hashed passwords, email addresses, residential addresses, GPS locations, list of installed apps, partially-masked credit card numbers, connected bank accounts and associated account numbers, and know your customer (KYC) documents of 3.5 million users.  Even worse, the leak also shows that MobiKwik does not&nbsp; delete the card information &nbsp;from its servers even after a user has removed them, in what's likely a breach of government regulations.  New guidelines issued by India's apex banking institution, the Reserve Bank of India,&nbsp; prohibit &nbsp;online merchants, e-commerce websites, and payment aggregators from storing card details of a customer online.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In yet another instance of a software supply chain attack,&nbsp;unidentified actors hacked the official Git server of the PHP programming language and pushed unauthorized updates to insert a secret backdoor into its source code.  The two malicious commits were pushed to the self-hosted "php-src" repository hosted on the git.php.net server, illicitly using the names of Rasmus Lerdorf, the author of the programming language, and Nikita Popov, a software developer at Jetbrains.  The changes are said to have been made yesterday on March 28.   "We don't yet know how exactly this happened, but everything points towards a compromise of the git.php.net server (rather than a compromise of an individual git account)," Popov&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an announcement.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) on Sunday said it had been a victim of a cyberattack targeting its Microsoft Exchange Servers, forcing it to&nbsp;temporarily take its email systems offline as a precautionary measure.

EBA said it's launched a full investigation into the incident in partnership with its information and communication technology (ICT) provider, a team of forensic experts, and other relevant entities.  In a second update issued on Monday, the agency said it had secured its email infrastructure and that it found no evidence of data extraction, adding it has "no indication to think that the breach has gone beyond our email servers."

Enterprise cloud security firm Qualys  has become the latest victim to join a long list of entities to have suffered a data breach after zero-day vulnerabilities in its Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) server were exploited to steal sensitive business documents.

The massive state-sponsored&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;that compromised software maker SolarWinds also targeted Microsoft, as the unfolding investigation into the hacking spree reveals the incident may have been far more wider in scope, sophistication, and impact than previously thought.  News of Microsoft's compromise was first reported by Reuters , which also said the company's own products were then used to strike other victims by leveraging its cloud offerings, citing people familiar with the matter.  The Windows maker, however, denied the threat actor had infiltrated its production systems to stage further attacks against its customers.  In a statement to The Hacker News via email, the company said —  "Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious SolarWinds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed.

Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed a new supply-chain attack targeting the Vietnam Government Certification Authority (VGCA) that compromised the agency's digital signature toolkit to install a backdoor on victim systems.  Uncovered by Slovak internet security company ESET  early this month, the "SignSight" attack involved modifying software installers hosted on the CA's&nbsp; website &nbsp;("ca.gov.vn") to insert a spyware tool called&nbsp; PhantomNet &nbsp;or Smanager.  According to ESET's telemetry, the breach happened from at least July 23 to August 16, 2020, with the&nbsp; two installers &nbsp;in question — "gca01-client-v2-x32-8.3.msi" and "gca01-client-v2-x64-8.3.msi" for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems — tampered to include the backdoor.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The investigation into how the attackers managed to compromise SolarWinds' internal network and poison the company's software updates are still underway, but we may one step close to understanding what appears to be a very meticulously planned and highly-sophisticated supply chain attack.  A new report  published by ReversingLabs today and shared in advance with The Hacker News has revealed that the operators behind the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;likely managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the malicious backdoor through its software release process.  "The source code of the affected library was directly modified to include malicious backdoor code, which was compiled, signed, and delivered through the existing software patch release management system," ReversingLabs' Tomislav Pericin said.
