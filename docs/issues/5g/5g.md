As 5G networks are being gradually rolled out in major cities across the world, an analysis of its network architecture has revealed a number of potential weaknesses that could be exploited to carry out a slew of cyber assaults, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks to deprive subscribers of Internet access and intercept data traffic.  The findings form the basis of a new " 5G Standalone core security research " published by London-based cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies today, exactly six months after the firm released its " Vulnerabilities in LTE and 5G Networks 2020 " report in June detailing high impact flaws in LTE and 5G protocols.  "Key elements of network security include proper configuration of equipment, as well as authentication and authorization of network elements," Positive Technologies said.   "In the absence of these elements, the network becomes vulnerable [to] subscriber denial of service due to exploitation of vulnerabil
