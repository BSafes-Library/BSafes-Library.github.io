Israeli Researcher Cracked Over 3500 Wi-Fi Networks in Tel Aviv City<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/israeli-researcher-cracked-over-3500-wi.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over 70% of Wi-Fi networks from a sample size of 5,000 were hacked with "relative ease" in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, highlighting how unsecure Wi-Fi passwords can become a gateway for serious threats to individuals, small businesses, and enterprises alike.  CyberArk security researcher Ido Hoorvitch, who used a Wi-Fi sniffing equipment costing about $50 to collect 5,000 network hashes for the study,&nbsp; said &nbsp;"the process of sniffing Wi-Fis and the subsequent cracking procedures was a very accessible undertaking in terms of equipment, costs and execution."   The new Wi-Fi attack builds on&nbsp; previous findings &nbsp;by Jens "atom" Steube in 2018 that involves capturing what's called the PMKIDs associated with a client (aka SSID) in order to attempt a brute-force attack using password recovery tools like hashcat.   PMKID is a&nbsp; unique key identifier &nbsp;used by the access point (AP) to keep track of the pre-shared key — i.e., pairwise master key aka PMK — being u

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Nobelium, the&nbsp; threat actor &nbsp;behind the SolarWinds compromise in December 2020, has been behind a new wave of attacks that compromised 14 downstream customers of multiple cloud service providers (CSP), managed service providers (MSP), and other IT services organizations, illustrating the adversary's continuing interest in targeting the supply chain via the "compromise-one-to-compromise-many" approach.  Microsoft, which disclosed details of the campaign on Monday, said it notified more than 140 resellers and technology service providers since May. Between July 1 and October 19, 2021, Nobelium is said to have singled out 609 customers, who were collectively attacked a grand total of 22,868 times.   "This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government,"

"FIN7 is adopting disinformation tactics so that if a potential hire or interested party were to fact check Bastion Secure, then a cursory search on Google would return 'true' information for companies with a similar name or industry to FIN7's Bastion Secure."

Hackers Stealing Browser Cookies to Hijack High-Profile YouTube Accounts<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/hackers-stealing-browser-cookies-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Since at least late 2019, a network of hackers-for-hire have been hijacking the channels of YouTube creators, luring them with bogus collaboration opportunities to broadcast cryptocurrency scams or sell the accounts to the highest bidder.  That's according to a new report published by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which said it disrupted financially motivated phishing campaigns targeting the video platform with cookie theft malware. The actors behind the infiltration have been attributed to a group of hackers recruited in a Russian-speaking forum.   "Cookie Theft, also known as 'pass-the-cookie attack,' is a&nbsp;session hijacking&nbsp;technique that enables access to user accounts with session cookies stored in the browser," TAG's Ashley Shen&nbsp; said . "While the technique has been around for decades, its resurgence as a top security risk could be due to a wider adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) making it difficult to conduct abuse, and shif

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly disclosed vulnerability affecting Intel processors could be abused by an adversary to gain access to sensitive information stored within enclaves and even run arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.  The vulnerability ( CVE-2021-0186 , CVSS score: 8.2) was discovered by a group of academics from ETH Zurich, the National University of Singapore, and the Chinese National University of Defense Technology in early May 2021, who used it to stage a confidential data disclosure attack called " SmashEx " that can corrupt private data housed in the enclave and break its integrity.   Introduced with Intel's Skylake processors, SGX (short for Software Guard eXtensions) allows developers to run selected application modules in a completely isolated secure compartment of memory, called an enclave or a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which is designed to be protected from processes running at higher privilege levels like the operating system. SGX ensures that data is secure

Google: We're Tracking 270 State-Sponsored Hacker Groups From Over 50 Countries<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/google-were-tracking-270-state.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) on Thursday&nbsp; said &nbsp;it's tracking more than 270 government-backed threat actors from more than 50 countries, adding it has approximately sent 50,000 alerts of state-sponsored phishing or malware attempts to customers since the start of 2021.  The warnings mark a 33% increase from 2020, the internet giant said, with the spike largely&nbsp; stemming &nbsp;from "blocking an unusually large campaign from a Russian actor known as APT28 or Fancy Bear."   Additionally, Google said it disrupted a number of campaigns mounted by an Iranian state-sponsored attacker group tracked as&nbsp; APT35 &nbsp;(aka Charming Kitten, Phosphorous, or Newscaster), including a sophisticated social engineering attack dubbed "Operation SpoofedScholars" aimed at think tanks, journalists, and professors with an aim to solicit sensitive information by masquerading as scholars with the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An emerging threat actor likely supporting Iranian national interests has been behind a password spraying campaign targeting US, EU, and Israeli defense technology companies, with additional activity observed against regional ports of entry in the Persian Gulf as well as maritime and cargo transportation companies focused in the Middle East.  Microsoft is tracking the hacking crew under the moniker DEV-0343 .  The intrusions, which were first observed in late July 2021, are believed to have targeted more than 250 Office 365 tenants, fewer than 20 of which were successfully compromised following a&nbsp; password spray &nbsp;attack — a type of brute force attack wherein the same password is cycled against different usernames to log into an application or a network in an effort to avoid account lockouts.   Indications thus far allude to the possibility that the activity is part of an intellectual property theft campaign aimed at government partners producing military-grade radars, drone technology

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Details have emerged about a new cyber espionage campaign directed against the aerospace and telecommunications industries, primarily in the Middle East, with the goal of stealing sensitive information about critical assets, organizations' infrastructure, and technology while remaining in the dark and successfully evading security solutions.  Boston-based cybersecurity company Cybereason dubbed the attacks " Operation Ghostshell ," pointing out the use of a previously undocumented and stealthy remote access trojan (RAT) called ShellClient that's deployed as the main spy tool of choice. The first sign of the attacks was observed in July 2021 against a handpicked set of victims, indicating a highly targeted approach.  "The ShellClient RAT has been under ongoing development since at least 2018, with several iterations that introduced new functionalities, while it evaded antivirus tools and managed to remain undetected and publicly unknown," researchers Tom Fak

"And once on a user's machine, the threat blends into the digital woodwork by using its own customized profile to hide its network traffic."

A formerly unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor has been linked to a long-standing evasive operation aimed at South East Asian targets as far back as July 2020 to deploy a kernel-mode rootkit on compromised Windows systems.  Attacks mounted by the hacking group, dubbed&nbsp; GhostEmperor &nbsp;by Kaspersky, are also said to have used a "sophisticated multi-stage malware framework" that allows for providing persistence and remote control over the targeted hosts.  The Russian cybersecurity firm called the rootkit Demodex , with infections reported across several high-profile entities in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, in addition to outliers located in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Afghanistan.   "[Demodex] is used to hide the user mode malware's artefacts from investigators and security solutions, while demonstrating an interesting undocumented loading scheme involving the kernel mode component of an open-source project named&nbsp; Cheat Engine &nbsp;to bypass the Windows Driver Sig

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed a previously undocumented backdoor likely designed and developed by the Nobelium advanced persistent threat (APT) behind last year's&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack , joining the threat actor's ever-expanding arsenal of hacking tools.  Moscow-headquartered firm Kaspersky codenamed the malware " Tomiris ,"&nbsp;calling out its similarities to another second-stage malware used during the campaign, SUNSHUTTLE (aka GoldMax), targeting the IT management software provider's Orion platform. Nobelium is also known by the monikers UNC2452, SolarStorm, StellarParticle, Dark Halo, and Iron Ritual.   "While supply-chain attacks were already a documented attack vector leveraged by a number of APT actors, this specific campaign stood out due to the extreme carefulness of the attackers and the high-profile nature of their victims," Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; said .

Google Warns of a New Way Hackers Can Make Malware Undetectable on Windows<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/google-warns-of-new-way-hackers-can.html"> Full Text</a>

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a novel technique adopted by threat actors to deliberately evade detection with the help of malformed digital signatures of its malware payloads.  "Attackers created malformed code signatures that are treated as valid by Windows but are not able to be decoded or checked by OpenSSL code — which is used in a number of security scanning products," Google Threat Analysis Group's Neel Mehta&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published on Thursday.   The new mechanism was observed to be exploited by a notorious family of unwanted software known as&nbsp; OpenSUpdater &nbsp;that's used to download and install other suspicious programs on compromised systems. Most targets of the campaign are users located in the U.S. who are prone to downloading cracked versions of games and other grey-area software.  The findings come from a set of OpenSUpdater&nbsp; samples &nbsp; uploaded &nbsp;to VirusTotal at least since mid-August.   Not only are the artifacts signed with an invalid l

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has shared technical details about a now-fixed, actively exploited critical security vulnerability affecting SolarWinds Serv-U managed file transfer service that it has attributed with "high confidence" to a threat actor operating out of China.  In mid-July, the Texas-based company&nbsp; remedied &nbsp;a remote code execution flaw ( CVE-2021-35211 ) that was rooted in Serv-U's implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which could be abused by attackers to run arbitrary code on the infected system, including the ability to install malicious programs and view, change, or delete sensitive data.   "The Serv-U SSH server is subject to a pre-auth remote code execution vulnerability that can be easily and reliably exploited in the default configuration," Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering team said in a&nbsp; detailed write-up &nbsp;describing the exploit.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A recent wave of spear-phishing campaigns leveraged weaponized Windows 11 Alpha-themed Word documents with Visual Basic macros to drop malicious payloads, including a JavaScript implant, against a point-of-sale (PoS) service provider located in the U.S.  The attacks, which are believed to have taken place between late June to late July 2021, have been attributed with "moderate confidence" to a financially motivated threat actor dubbed FIN7, according to researchers from cybersecurity firm Anomali.  "The specified targeting of the Clearmind domain fits well with FIN7's preferred modus operandi," Anomali Threat Research&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical analysis published on September 2. "The group's goal appears to have been to deliver a variation of a JavaScript backdoor used by FIN7 since at least 2018."

IT and communication companies in Israel were at the center of a supply chain attack campaign spearheaded by an Iranian threat actor that involved impersonating the firms and their HR personnel to target victims with fake job offers in an attempt to penetrate their computers and gain access to the company's clients.  The attacks, which occurred in two waves in May and July 2021, have been linked to a hacker group called Siamesekitten (aka Lyceum or Hexane) that has primarily singled out oil, gas, and telecom providers in the Middle East and in Africa at least since 2018, researchers from ClearSky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published Tuesday.   Infections undertaken by the adversary commenced with identifying potential victims, who were then enticed with "alluring" job offers in well-known companies like ChipPc and Software AG by posing as human resources department employees from the impersonated firms, only to lead the victims to a phishing website containing weaponized files t

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft has disclosed details of an evasive year-long social engineering campaign wherein the operators kept changing their obfuscation and encryption mechanisms every 37 days on average, including relying on Morse code, in an attempt to cover their tracks and surreptitiously harvest user credentials.  The phishing attacks take the form of invoice-themed lures mimicking financial-related business transactions, with the emails containing an HTML file ("XLS.HTML"). The ultimate objective is to harvest usernames and passwords, which are subsequently used as an initial entry point for later infiltration attempts.   Microsoft likened the attachment to a "jigsaw puzzle," noting that individual parts of the HTML file are designed to appear innocuous and slip past endpoint security software, only to reveal its true colors when these segments are decoded and assembled together. The company did not identify the hackers behind the operation.  "This phishing campaign ex

A Chinese cyber espionage group has been linked to a string of intrusion activities targeting Israeli government institutions, IT providers, and telecommunications companies at least since 2019.  FireEye's Mandiant threat intelligence arm attributed the campaign to an operator it tracks as "UNC215", a Chinese espionage operation that's believed to have singled out organizations around the world dating back as far as 2014, linking the group with "low confidence" to an advanced persistent threat (APT) widely known as&nbsp; APT27 , Emissary Panda, or Iron Tiger.  "UNC215 has compromised organizations in the government, technology, telecommunications, defense, finance, entertainment, and health care sectors," FireEye's Israel and U.S. threat intel teams&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published today.

A Chinese cyberespionage group known for targeting Southeast Asia leveraged flaws in the Microsoft Exchange Server that came to light earlier this March to deploy a previously undocumented variant of a remote access trojan (RAT) on compromised systems.  Attributing the intrusions to a threat actor named&nbsp; PKPLUG &nbsp;(aka&nbsp; Mustang Panda &nbsp;and HoneyMyte), Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team said it identified a new version of the modular PlugX malware, called Thor, that was delivered as a post-exploitation tool to one of the breached servers.

An Iranian cyberespionage group masqueraded as an aerobics instructor on Facebook in an attempt to infect the machine of an employee of an aerospace defense contractor with malware as part of a years-long social engineering and targeted malware campaign.

"Using the social media persona 'Marcella Flores,' TA456 built a relationship across corporate and personal communication platforms with an employee of a small subsidiary of an aerospace defense contractor," Proofpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "In early June 2021, the threat actor attempted to capitalize on this relationship by sending the target malware via an ongoing email communication chain."   Earlier this month, Facebook&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;it took steps to dismantle a &amp;quo

Facebook on Thursday disclosed it dismantled a "sophisticated" online cyber espionage campaign conducted by Iranian hackers targeting about 200 military personnel  and companies in the defense and aerospace sectors in the U.S., U.K., and Europe using fake online personas on its platform.  The social media giant pinned the attacks to a threat actor known as&nbsp; Tortoiseshell &nbsp;(aka Imperial Kitten) based on the fact that the adversary used similar techniques in past campaigns attributed to the threat group, which was&nbsp; previously &nbsp; known &nbsp;to focus on the information technology industry in Saudi Arabia, suggesting an apparent expansion of malicious activity.   "This group used various malicious tactics to identify its targets and infect their devices with malware to enable espionage,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Mike Dvilyanski, Head of Cyber Espionage Investigations, and David Agranovich, Director, Threat Disruption, at Facebook.

A sophisticated social engineering attack undertaken by an Iranian-state aligned actor targeted think tanks, journalists, and professors with an aim to solicit sensitive information by masquerading as scholars with the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).

Cybercrime actors part of the Magecart group have latched on to a new technique of obfuscating the malware code within&nbsp; comment blocks &nbsp;and encoding stolen credit card data into images and other files hosted on the server, once again demonstrating how the attackers are&nbsp; continuously improving &nbsp;their infection chains to escape detection.

"These can later be downloaded using a simple&nbsp; GET request &nbsp;at a later date."   MageCart is the umbrella term given to multiple groups of cybercriminals targeting e-commerce websites with the goal of plundering credit card numbers by injecting malicious JavaScript skimmers and selling them on the black market.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
While it's a norm for phishing campaigns that distribute weaponized Microsoft Office documents to prompt victims to enable macros in order to trigger the infection chain directly, new findings indicate attackers are using non-malicious documents to disable security warnings prior to executing macro code to infect victims' computers.  In yet another instance of malware authors continue to evolve their techniques to evade detection, researchers from McAfee Labs stumbled upon a novel tactic that "downloads and executes malicious DLLs (ZLoader) without any malicious code present in the initial spammed attachment macro."   ZLoader&nbsp;infections  propagated using this mechanism have been primarily reported in the U.S., Canada, Spain, Japan, and Malaysia, the cybersecurity firm noted. The malware — a descendant of the infamous ZeuS banking trojan — is well known for aggressively using macro-enabled Office documents as an initial attack vector to steal credentials and personall

Microsoft on Friday said it's investigating an incident wherein a driver signed by the company turned out to be a malicious Windows rootkit that was observed communicating with command-and-control (C2) servers located in China.  The driver, called " Netfilter ," is said to target gaming environments, specifically in the East Asian country, with the Redmond-based firm noting that "the actor's goal is to use the driver to spoof their geo-location to cheat the system and play from anywhere."   "The malware enables them to gain an advantage in games and possibly exploit other players by compromising their accounts through common tools like keyloggers," Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)&nbsp; said .  The rogue code signing was spotted by Karsten Hahn, a malware analyst at German cybersecurity company G Data, who shared&nbsp; additional details &nbsp;of the rootkit, including a&nbsp; dropper , which is used to deploy and install Netfilter on the system.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A threat actor with suspected ties to Pakistan has been striking government and energy organizations in the South and Central Asia regions to deploy a remote access trojan on compromised Windows systems, according to new research.  "Most of the organizations that exhibited signs of compromise were in India, and a small number were in Afghanistan," Lumen's Black Lotus Labs&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "The potentially compromised victims aligned with the government and power utility verticals."  Some of the victims include a foreign government organization, a power transmission organization, and a power generation and transmission organization. The covert operation is said to have begun at least in January 2021.   The intrusions are notable for a number of reasons, not least because in addition to its highly-targeted nature, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by the adversary rely on repurposed open-source code and the use of compromised dom

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A string of cyber espionage campaigns dating all the way back to 2014 and focused on gathering military intelligence from neighbouring countries have been linked to a Chinese military-intelligence apparatus.  In a wide-ranging report published by Massachusetts-headquartered Recorded Future this week, the cybersecurity firm's Insikt Group said it identified ties between a group it tracks as " RedFoxtrot " to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 69010 operating out of Ürümqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the country.   Previously called the Lanzhou Military Region's Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureau, Unit 69010 is a military cover for a Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) within China's Strategic Support Force (SSF) Network Systems Department ( NSD ).   The connection to PLA Unit 69010 stems from what the researchers said were "lax operational security measures" adopted by an unnamed suspected RedFoxtrot threat act

Researchers Demonstrate 2 New Hacks to Modify Certified PDF Documents<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/researchers-demonstrate-2-new-hacks-to.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed two new attack techniques on certified PDF documents that could potentially enable an attacker to alter a document's visible content by displaying malicious content over the certiﬁed content without invalidating its signature.  "The attack idea exploits the flexibility of PDF certification, which allows signing or adding annotations to certified documents under different permission levels,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;researchers from Ruhr-University Bochum, who have&nbsp; systematically &nbsp; analyzed &nbsp;the security of the PDF specification over the years.  The findings were presented at the 42nd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy ( IEEE S&amp;P 2021 ) held this week.  The two attacks — dubbed&nbsp; Evil Annotation and Sneaky Signature attacks &nbsp;— hinge on manipulating the PDF certification process by exploiting flaws in the specification that governs the implementation of digital signatures (aka approval signature) and its more flexible variant called certifica

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers from FireEye unmasked additional tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by Chinese threat actors who were recently found abusing Pulse Secure VPN devices to drop malicious web shells and exfiltrate sensitive information from enterprise networks.  FireEye's Mandiant threat intelligence team, which is tracking the cyberespionage activity under two threat clusters UNC2630 and UNC2717,&nbsp; said &nbsp;the intrusions line up with key Chinese government priorities, adding "many compromised organizations operate in verticals and industries aligned with Beijing's strategic objectives outlined in China's recent&nbsp; 14th Five Year Plan ."   On April 20, the cybersecurity firm&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;12 different malware families, including STEADYPULSE and LOCKPICK, that have been designed with the express intent to infect Pulse Secure VPN appliances and put to use by several cyberespionage groups believed to be affiliated with the Chinese government.

Hackers Using Fake Foundations to Target Uyghur Minority in China<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/hackers-using-fake-foundations-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Uyghur community located in China and Pakistan has been the subject of an ongoing espionage campaign aiming to trick the targets into downloading a Windows backdoor to amass sensitive information from their systems.  "Considerable effort was put into disguising the payloads, whether by creating delivery documents that appear to be originating from the United Nations using up to date related themes, or by setting up websites for non-existing organizations claiming to fund charity groups," according to joint research published by Check Point Research  and Kaspersky today.  The Uyghurs are a Turkic ethnic minority group originating from Central and East Asia and are recognized as native to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China. At least since 2015, government authorities have placed the region under tight surveillance, putting hundreds of thousands into prisons and internment camps that the government calls "Vocational Education and Training Centers.

Cybercriminals with suspected ties to Pakistan continue to rely on social engineering as a crucial component of its operations as part of an evolving espionage campaign against Indian targets, according to new research.

"While military and defense personnel continue to be the group's primary targets, Transparent Tribe is increasingly targeting diplomatic entities, defense contractors, research organizations and conference attendees, indicating that the group is expanding its targeting," researchers from Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Thursday.

Cybercrime groups are distributing malicious PHP web shells disguised as a favicon to maintain remote access to the compromised servers and inject JavaScript skimmers into online shopping platforms with an aim to steal financial information from their users.  "These web shells known as Smilodon or Megalodon are used to dynamically load JavaScript skimming code via server-side requests into online stores," Malwarebytes Jérôme Segura&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up. "This technique is interesting as most client-side security tools will not be able to detect or block the skimmer."  Injecting web skimmers on e-commerce websites to steal credit card details is a tried-and-tested modus operandi of Magecart, a consortium of different hacker groups who target online shopping cart systems. Also known as formjacking attacks, the skimmers take the form of JavaScript code that the operators stealthily insert into an e-commerce website, often on payment pages, with an intent to c

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An adversary known for its&nbsp; watering hole attacks &nbsp;against government entities has been linked to a slew of newly detected intrusions targeting various organizations in Central Asia and the Middle East.  The malicious activity, collectively named "EmissarySoldier," has been attributed to a threat actor called LuckyMouse, and is said to have happened in 2020 with the goal of obtaining geopolitical insights in the region. The attacks involved deploying a toolkit dubbed SysUpdate  (aka Soldier) in a number of breached organizations, including government and diplomatic agencies, telecom providers, a TV media company, and a commercial bank.   LuckyMouse , also referred to as APT27 and Emissary Panda, is a sophisticated cyberespionage group that has a history of breaching multiple government networks in Central Asia and the Middle East. The actor has also been linked to cyberattacks aimed at transnational organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO )

The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) of the District of Columbia has become the latest high-profile government agency to fall victim to a ransomware attack.  The Babuk Locker gang claimed in a post on the dark web that they had compromised the DC Police's networks and stolen 250 GB of unencrypted files. Screenshots shared by the group, and seen by The Hacker News, include various folders containing what appears to be investigation reports, arrests, disciplinary actions, and other intelligence briefings.  Also called the DC Police, the MPD is the primary law enforcement agency for the District of Columbia in the U.S.   The ransomware gang has given the department three days to heed to their ransom demand or risk leaking sensitive files that could expose police informants to criminal gangs.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security is only as strong as the weakest link. As further proof of this, Apple released an update to macOS operating systems to address an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability that could circumvent all security protections, thus permitting unapproved software to run on Macs.  The macOS flaw, identified as&nbsp; CVE-2021-30657 , was discovered and reported to Apple by security engineer Cedric Owens on March 25, 2021.  "An unsigned, unnotarized, script-based proof of concept application [...] could trivially and reliably sidestep all of macOS's relevant security mechanisms (File Quarantine, Gatekeeper, and Notarization Requirements), even on a fully patched M1 macOS system," security researcher Patrick Wardle&nbsp; explained &nbsp;in a write-up. "Armed with such a capability macOS malware authors could (and are) returning to their proven methods of targeting and infecting macOS users."   Apple's macOS comes with a feature called&nbsp; Gatekeeper , which allows only&nbsp; truste

Researchers Find Additional Infrastructure Used By SolarWinds Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/researchers-find-additional.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The sprawling&nbsp; SolarWinds cyberattack &nbsp;which came to light last December was known for its sophistication in the breadth of tactics used to infiltrate and persist in the target infrastructure, so much so that Microsoft went on to call the threat actor behind the campaign "skillful and methodic operators who follow operations security (OpSec) best practices to minimize traces, stay under the radar, and avoid detection."  But&nbsp; new research &nbsp;published today shows that the threat actor carefully planned each stage of the operation to "avoid creating the type of patterns that make tracking them simple," thus deliberately making forensic analysis difficult.  By analyzing telemetry data associated with previously published indicators of compromise, RiskIQ said it identified an additional set of 18 servers with high confidence that likely communicated with the targeted, secondary Cobalt Strike payloads delivered via the TEARDROP and RAINDROP malware, representing a 56% jum

If the Pulse Connect Secure gateway is part of your organization network, you need to be aware of a newly discovered critical zero-day authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2021-22893) that is currently being exploited in the wild and for which there is no patch yet.  At least two threat actors have been behind a series of intrusions targeting defense, government, and financial organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere by leveraging critical vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN devices to circumvent multi-factor authentication protections and breach enterprise networks.  "A combination of prior vulnerabilities and a previously unknown vulnerability discovered in April 2021,&nbsp; CVE-2021-22893 , are responsible for the initial infection vector," cybersecurity firm FireEye&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Tuesday, identifying 12 malware families associated with the exploitation of Pulse Secure VPN appliances.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
APKPure, one of the largest alternative app stores outside of the Google Play Store, was infected with malware this week, allowing threat actors to distribute Trojans to Android devices.  In an incident that's similar to that of German telecommunications&nbsp; equipment manufacturer Gigaset , the APKPure client version 3.17.18 is said to have been tampered with in an attempt to trick unsuspecting users into downloading and installing malicious applications linked to the malicious code built into the APKpure app.  The development was reported by researchers from&nbsp; Doctor Web &nbsp;and&nbsp; Kaspersky .   "This trojan belongs to the dangerous Android.Triada malware family capable of downloading, installing and uninstalling software without users' permission," Doctor Web researchers said.  According to Kaspersky, the APKPure version 3.17.18 was tweaked to incorporate an advertisement SDK that acts as a Trojan dropper designed to deliver other malware to a victim's device. "Thi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A hacking group related to a Chinese-speaking threat actor has been linked to an advanced cyberespionage campaign targeting government and military organizations in Vietnam.  The attacks have been attributed with low confidence to the advanced persistent threat (APT) called&nbsp; Cycldek &nbsp;(or Goblin Panda, Hellsing, APT 27, and Conimes), which is known for using spear-phishing techniques to compromise diplomatic targets in Southeast Asia, India, and the U.S. at least since 2013.  According to researchers from Kaspersky, the offensive, which was observed between June 2020 and January 2021, leverages a method called DLL side-loading to execute shellcode that decrypts a final payload dubbed " FoundCore ."   DLL side-loading &nbsp;has been a tried-and-tested technique used by various threat actors as an obfuscation tactic to bypass antivirus defenses. By loading malicious DLLs into legitimate executables, the idea is to mask their malicious activity under a trusted system or software proc

A North Korean government-backed campaign targeting cybersecurity researchers with malware has re-emerged with new tactics in their arsenal as part of a fresh social engineering attack.

"The new website claims the company is an offensive security company located in Turkey that offers pentests, software security assessments and exploits," TAG's Adam Weidemann&nbsp; said . The website is said to have gone live on March 17.

Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed details of a sophisticated campaign that deploys malicious backdoors for the purpose of exfiltrating information from a number of industry sectors located in Japan.  Dubbed "A41APT" by Kaspersky researchers, the findings delve into a new slew of attacks undertaken by&nbsp; APT10 &nbsp;(aka Stone Panda or Cicada) using previously undocumented malware to deliver as many as three payloads such as SodaMaster, P8RAT, and FYAnti.  The long-running intelligence-gathering operation first came into the scene in March 2019, with activities spotted as recently as November 2020, when&nbsp; reports &nbsp;emerged of Japan-linked companies being targeted by the threat actor in over 17 regions worldwide.   The fresh attacks uncovered by Kaspersky are said to have occurred in January 2021.

It's not every day that one of the best-known independent cybersecurity individuals joins a cybersecurity company. The two are generally on opposite sides of the coin, with little crossover.  After all, they're usually concerned with different parts of the cybersecurity puzzle – one providing platforms and tools to defend organizations, the other keeping them accountable and looking for blind spots in even the best security tools.  That seems to be changing, however, with a recent appointment.  Cynet, an Autonomous XDR provider that recently closed a Series C funding round worth $40 million, announced that it has hired Chris Roberts as their Chief Security Strategist.  Roberts is world-renowned in counter-threat intelligence, as well as in vulnerability and threat research fields, thanks to decades of experience. As part of his efforts at Cynet, Roberts will be focusing his work on helping empower and connect security professionals from organizations outside of the Fortune 200

A malicious web shell deployed on Windows systems by leveraging a previously undisclosed zero-day in SolarWinds' Orion network monitoring software may have been the work of a possible Chinese threat group.  In a&nbsp; report &nbsp;published by Secureworks on Monday, the cybersecurity firm attributed the intrusions to a threat actor it calls Spiral.  Back on December 22, 2020, Microsoft&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that a second espionage group may have been abusing the IT infrastructure provider's Orion software to drop a persistent backdoor called Supernova on target systems.  The findings were also corroborated by cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks'&nbsp; Unit 42 &nbsp;threat intelligence team and&nbsp; GuidePoint Security , both of whom described Supernova as a .NET web shell implemented by modifying an "app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll" module of the SolarWinds Orion application.

Hackers with suspected ties to Iran are actively targeting academia, government agencies, and tourism entities in the Middle East and neighboring regions as part of an espionage campaign aimed at data theft.  Dubbed "Earth Vetala" by Trend Micro, the latest finding expands on previous research&nbsp; published by Anomali &nbsp;last month, which found evidence of malicious activity aimed at UAE and Kuwait government agencies by exploiting ScreenConnect remote management tool.&nbsp;  The cybersecurity firm linked the ongoing attacks with moderate confidence to a threat actor widely tracked as&nbsp; MuddyWater , an Iranian hacker group known for its offensives primarily against Middle Eastern nations.   Earth Vetala is said to have leveraged spear-phishing emails containing embedded links to a popular file-sharing service called Onehub to distribute malware that ranged from password dumping utilities to custom backdoors, before initiating communications with a command-and-control (C2) server to exe

First documented in&nbsp; February 2020 , the malware has been linked to a threat actor tracked as&nbsp; Transparent Tribe &nbsp;(aka Operation C-Major, Mythic Leopard, or APT36), a highly prolific group allegedly of Pakistani origin known for its attacks against human rights activists in the country as well as military and government personnel in India.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A prolific North Korean state-sponsored hacking group has been tied to a new ongoing espionage campaign aimed at exfiltrating sensitive information from organizations in the defense industry.  Attributing the attacks with high confidence to the&nbsp; Lazarus Group , the new findings from Kaspersky signal an expansion of the APT actor's tactics by going beyond the usual gamut of financially-motivated crimes to fund the cash-strapped regime.&nbsp;  This broadening of its strategic interests happened in early 2020 by leveraging a tool called ThreatNeedle , researchers Vyacheslav Kopeytsev and Seongsu Park said in a Thursday write-up.  At a high level, the campaign leverages a multi-step approach that begins with a carefully crafted spear-phishing attack leading eventually to the attackers gaining remote control over the devices.   ThreatNeedle is delivered to targets via COVID-themed emails with malicious Microsoft Word attachments as initial infection vectors that, when opened, run a macro co

Ukraine is formally pointing fingers at Russian hackers for hacking into one of its government systems and attempting to plant and distribute malicious documents that would install malware on target systems of public authorities.  "The purpose of the attack was the mass contamination of information resources of public authorities, as this system is used for the circulation of documents in most public authorities," the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (NSDC)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement published on Wednesday.   The NSDC's National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity (NCCC) termed it a supply chain attack aimed at the System of Electronic Interaction of Executive Bodies (SEI EB), which is used to distribute documents to officials.  Calling it a work of threat actors with ties to Russia, the NSDC said the malicious documents came embedded with a macro that, when opened, stealthily downloaded malicious code to control the compromised system remotely.

Hackers Exploit Accellion Zero-Days in Recent Data Theft and Extortion Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/hackers-exploit-accellion-zero-days-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday tied a&nbsp; string of attacks &nbsp;targeting Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) servers over the past two months to data theft and extortion campaign orchestrated by a cybercrime group called UNC2546 .  The attacks, which began in mid-December 2020, involved exploiting multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in the legacy FTA software to install a new web shell named DEWMODE on victim networks and exfiltrating sensitive data, which was then published on a data leak website operated by the CLOP ransomware gang.  But in a twist, no ransomware was actually deployed in any of the recent incidents that hit organizations in the U.S., Singapore, Canada, and the Netherlands, with the actors instead resorting to extortion emails to threaten victims into paying bitcoin ransoms.   According to&nbsp; Risky Business , some of the companies that have had their data listed on the site include Singapore's telecom provider&nbsp; SingTel , the American Bureau of Shipping, law firm

On August 13, 2016, a hacking unit calling itself " The Shadow Brokers " announced that it had stolen malware tools and exploits used by the Equation Group, a sophisticated threat actor believed to be affiliated to the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit of the U.S.&nbsp; National Security Agency &nbsp;(NSA).  Although the group has since signed off following the unprecedented disclosures, new "conclusive" evidence unearthed by Check Point Research shows that this was not an isolated incident.  The previously undocumented cyber-theft took place more than two years before the Shadow Brokers episode, the American-Israeli cybersecurity company said in an exhaustive report published today, resulting in U.S.-developed cyber tools reaching the hands of a Chinese advanced persistent threat which then repurposed them in order to attack U.S. targets.

Microsoft, on Thursday, said it concluded its probe into the SolarWinds hack, finding that the attackers stole some source code but confirmed there's no evidence that they abused its internal systems to target other companies or gained access to production services or customer data.

"We detected unusual activity with a small number of internal accounts and upon review, we discovered one account had been used to view source code in a number of source code repositories," the Windows maker had previously disclosed.   "The account did not have permissions to modify any code or engineering systems and our investigation further confirmed no changes were made. These accounts were investigated and remediated.".

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new kind of Office malware distributed as part of a malicious email campaign that targeted more than 80 customers worldwide in an attempt to control victim machines and steal information remotely.  The tool — dubbed " APOMacroSploit " — is a macro exploit generator that allows the user to create an Excel document capable of bypassing antivirus software, Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), and even Gmail and other email-based phishing detection.  APOMacroSploit is believed to be the work of two French-based threat actors "Apocaliptique" and "Nitrix," who are estimated to have made at least $5000 in less than two months selling the product on HackForums.net.   About 40 hackers in total are said to be behind the operation, utilizing 100 different email senders in a slew of attacks targeting users in more than 30 different countries. The attacks were spotted for the first time at the end of November 2020, acco

Russia-linked state-sponsored threat actor known as Sandworm has been linked to a three-year-long stealthy operation to hack targets by exploiting an IT monitoring tool called Centreon .  The intrusion campaign — which breached "several French entities" — is said to have started in late 2017 and lasted until 2020, with the attacks particularly impacting web-hosting providers, said the French information security agency ANSSI in an advisory.  "On compromised systems, ANSSI discovered the presence of a backdoor in the form of a webshell dropped on several Centreon servers exposed to the internet," the agency&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Monday. "This backdoor was identified as being the PAS webshell, version number 3.1.4. On the same servers, ANSSI found another backdoor identical to one described by ESET and named Exaramel."

SonicWall on Monday warned of active exploitation attempts against a zero-day vulnerability in its Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series devices.  The flaw, which affects both physical and virtual SMA 100 10.x devices (SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA 400, SMA 410, SMA 500v), came to light after the NCC Group on Sunday&nbsp; alerted &nbsp;it had detected "indiscriminate use of an exploit in the wild."  Details of the exploit have not been disclosed to prevent the zero-day from being exploited further, but a patch is expected to be available by the end of day on February 2, 2021.   "A few thousand devices are impacted," SonicWall&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement, adding, "SMA 100 firmware prior to 10.x is unaffected by this zero-day vulnerability."  On January 22, The Hacker News exclusively&nbsp; revealed &nbsp;that SonicWall had been breached as a consequence of a coordinated attack on its internal systems by exploiting "probable zero-day vulnerabilities" in its SMA 100 series remote a

A "persistent attacker group" with alleged ties to Hezbollah has retooled its malware arsenal with a new version of a remote access Trojan (RAT) to break into companies worldwide and extract valuable information.  In a&nbsp; new report &nbsp;published by the ClearSky research team on Thursday, the Israeli cybersecurity firm said it identified at least 250 public-facing web servers since early 2020 that have been hacked by the threat actor to gather intelligence and steal the company's databases.  The orchestrated intrusions hit a slew of companies located in the U.S., the U.K., Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority, with a majority of the victims representing telecom operators (Etisalat, Mobily, Vodafone Egypt), internet service providers (SaudiNet, TE Data), and hosting and infrastructure service providers (Secured Servers LLC, iomart).

Google on Monday disclosed details about an ongoing campaign carried out by a government-backed threat actor from North Korea that has targeted security researchers working on vulnerability research and development.  The internet giant's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said the adversary created a research blog and multiple profiles on various social media platforms such as Twitter, Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, Discord, and Keybase in a bid to communicate with the researchers and build trust.  The goal, it appears, is to steal exploits developed by the researchers for possibly undisclosed vulnerabilities, thereby allowing them to stage further attacks on vulnerable targets of their choice.   "Their blog contains write-ups and analysis of vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed, including 'guest' posts from unwitting legitimate security researchers, likely in an attempt to build additional credibility with other security researchers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;TAG researcher A

Microsoft on Wednesday shared more specifics about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by the attackers behind the SolarWinds hack to stay under the radar and avoid detection, as cybersecurity companies work towards getting a "clearer picture" of one of the most sophisticated attacks in recent history.  Calling the threat actor "skillful and methodic operators who follow operations security (OpSec) best practices," the company said the attackers went out of their way to ensure that the initial backdoor ( Sunburst &nbsp;aka Solorigate) and the post-compromise implants ( Teardrop &nbsp;and&nbsp; Raindrop ) are separated as much as possible so as to hinder efforts to spot their malicious activity.  "The attackers behind Solorigate are skilled campaign operators who carefully planned and executed the attack, remaining elusive while maintaining persistence," researchers from Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)

Hackers Accidentally Expose Passwords Stolen From Businesses On the Internet<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/hackers-accidentally-expose-passwords.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new large-scale phishing campaign targeting global organizations has been found to bypass Microsoft Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) and steal credentials belonging to over a thousand corporate employees.  The cyber offensive is said to have originated in August last year, with the attacks aimed specifically at energy and construction companies, said researchers from Check Point Research today in a joint analysis in partnership with industrial cybersecurity firm Otorio.  Although phishing campaigns engineered for credential theft are among the most prevalent reasons for data breaches, what makes this operation stand out is an operational security failure that led to the attackers unintentionally exposing the credentials they had stolen to the public Internet.  "With a simple Google search, anyone could have found the password to one of the compromised, stolen email addresses: a gift to every opportunistic attacker," the researchers said .

SolarWinds Hackers Also Breached Malwarebytes Cybersecurity Firm<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/solarwinds-hackers-also-breached.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malwarebytes on Tuesday said it was breached by the same group who broke into SolarWinds to access some of its internal emails, making it the fourth major cybersecurity vendor to be targeted after&nbsp; FireEye ,&nbsp; Microsoft , and&nbsp; CrowdStrike .  The company said its intrusion was not the result of a SolarWinds compromise, but rather due to a separate initial access vector that works by "abusing applications with privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure environments."  The discovery was made after Microsoft notified Malwarebytes of suspicious activity from a dormant email protection app within its&nbsp; Office 365 tenant &nbsp;on December 15, following which it performed a detailed investigation into the incident.   "While Malwarebytes does not use SolarWinds, we, like many other companies were recently targeted by the same threat actor," the company's CEO Marcin Kleczynski&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A North Korean hacking group has been found deploying the RokRat Trojan  in a new spear-phishing campaign targeting the South Korean government.  Attributing the attack to&nbsp; APT37 &nbsp;(aka Starcruft, Ricochet Chollima, or Reaper), Malwarebytes said it identified a malicious document last December that, when opened, executes a macro in memory to install the aforementioned remote access tool (RAT).  "The file contains an embedded macro that uses a VBA self decoding technique to decode itself within the memory spaces of Microsoft Office without writing to the disk. It then embeds a variant of the RokRat into Notepad," the researchers&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in a Wednesday analysis.   Believed to be active at least since 2012, the&nbsp; Reaper APT &nbsp;is known for its focus on public and private entities primarily in South Korea, such as chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and healthcare entities. Since then, their victimization has expanded beyond the Korean peninsula to include

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Thursday revealed that the threat actors behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack were able to gain access to a small number of internal accounts and escalate access inside its internal network.  The "very sophisticated nation-state actor" used the unauthorized access to view, but not modify, the source code present in its repositories, the company said.   "We detected unusual activity with a small number of internal accounts and upon review, we discovered one account had been used to view source code in a number of source code repositories," the Windows maker&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;in an update.  "The account did not have permissions to modify any code or engineering systems and our investigation further confirmed no changes were made. These accounts were investigated and remediated."  The development is the latest in the far-reaching&nbsp; espionage saga &nbsp;that came to light earlier in December following revelations by cybersecurity firm FireEye that attac

Microsoft Warns CrowdStrike of Hackers Targeting Azure Cloud Customers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/microsoft-warns-crowdstrike-of-hackers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New evidence amidst the ongoing probe into the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;targeting SolarWinds has uncovered an unsuccessful attempt to compromise cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike and access the company's email.  The hacking endeavor was reported to the company by Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center on December 15, which identified a third-party reseller's Microsoft Azure account to be making "abnormal calls" to Microsoft cloud APIs during a 17-hour period several months ago.  The undisclosed affected reseller's Azure account handles Microsoft Office licensing for its Azure customers, including CrowdStrike.  Although there was an attempt by unidentified threat actors to read email, it was ultimately foiled as the firm does not use Microsoft's Office 365 email service, CrowdStrike&nbsp; said .   The incident comes in the wake of the&nbsp; supply chain attack &nbsp;of SolarWinds revealed earlier this month, resulting in the deployment of a covert backdoor (aka "Sunburst&amp;q

As the probe into the&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack &nbsp;continues, new digital forensic evidence has brought to light that a separate threat actor may have been abusing the IT infrastructure provider's Orion software to drop a similar persistent backdoor on target systems.  "The investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor," Microsoft 365 research team&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Friday in a post detailing the Sunburst malware.  What makes the newly revealed malware, dubbed "Supernova," different is that unlike the Sunburst DLL,&nbsp; Supernova &nbsp;("app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll") is not signed with a legitimate SolarWinds digital certificate, signaling that the compromise may be unrelated to the previously disclosed supply chain attack.
