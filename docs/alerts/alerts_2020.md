Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations<a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is aware of compromises of U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private sector organizations by an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor beginning in at least March 2020. This APT actor has demonstrated patience, operational security, and complex tradecraft in these intrusions. CISA expects that removing this threat actor from compromised environments will be highly complex and challenging for organizations.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Malicious cyber actors are abusing trust in federated authentication environments to access protected data. The exploitation occurs after the actors have gained initial access to a victim’s on-premises network. The actors leverage privileged access in the on-premises environment to subvert the mechanisms that the organization uses to grant access to cloud and on-premises resources and/or to compromise administrator credentials with the ability to manage cloud resources. The actors demonstrate two sets of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for gaining access to the victim network’s cloud resources, often with a particular focus on organizational email.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory was coauthored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC).  

The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC assess malicious cyber actors are targeting kindergarten through twelfth grade (K-12) educational institutions, leading to ransomware attacks, the theft of data, and the disruption of distance learning services. Cyber actors likely view schools as targets of opportunity, and these types of attacks are expected to continue through the 2020/2021 academic year. These issues will be particularly challenging for K-12 schools that face resource limitations; therefore, educational leadership, information technology personnel, and security personnel will need to balance this risk when determining their cybersecurity investments.

Cyber Criminals Exploit Email Rule Vulnerability to Increase the Likelihood of Successful Business Email Compromise<a href="https://publications.bsafes.com/docs/fbi/pin-2020-1125-001-cyber-criminals-exploit-email-rule-vulnerability/"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a mass shift to telework among many US businesses, resulting in increased use of web-based email applications. According to recent FBI reporting, cyber criminals are implementing auto-forwarding rules on victims’ web-based email clients to conceal their activities. The web-based client’s forwarding rules often do not sync with the desktop client, limiting the rules’ visibility to cyber security administrators. Cyber criminals then capitalize on this reduced visibility to increase the likelihood of a successful business email compromise (BEC). BEC schemes resulted in more than $1.7 billion in worldwide lossesa reported to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) in 2019. The FBI is sharing this information to inform companies of this email rule forwarding vulnerability, which may leave businesses more susceptible to BEC.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The FBI first observed Ragnar Locker1 ransomware in April 2020, when unknown actors used it to encrypt a large corporation’s files for an approximately $11 million ransom and threatened to release 10 TB of sensitive company data. Since then, Ragnar Locker has been deployed against an increasing list of victims, including cloud service providers, communication, construction, travel, and enterprise software companies. The FBI is providing details of Ragnar Locker ransomware to assist with understanding the code and identifying the activity. Ragnar Locker actors first obtain access to a victim’s network and perform reconnaissance to locate network resources, backups, or other sensitive files for data exfiltration. In the final stage of the attack, actors manually deploy the ransomware, encrypting the victim’s data.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The FBI has observed entities not associated with the US Census Bureau registering numerous domains spoofing the Bureau’s websites, likely for malicious purposes. These suspicious spoofed domains are easily mistaken for legitimate Census Bureau websites and can be used for advertising, credential harvesting, and other malicious purposes. Spoofed domains (aka typosquatting) mimic legitimate domains by either altering character(s) within the domain or associating another domain with similar characteristics to the legitimate domain, such as “Censusburea[.]com” or “census gov[.]us” Spoofed domains are increasingly used by cyber criminal and state-sponsored groups to propagate the spread of malware, which can lead to further compromise and financial losses. This activity poses a risk to both the US Census Bureau and the public.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Out-of-Band (OoB) network management is a concept that uses an alternate communication path to manage network infrastructure devices. These alternate paths are designed to isolate management traffic from operational traffic. This isolation prevents compromised user devices or malicious network traffic from impacting network operations or compromising network infrastructure. Implementing these alternate paths can vary in configuration from virtual tunneling (sharing the physical network connections with the operational network) to a physically segmented network infrastructure. OoB management creates a framework that enables administrators to improve the security of their networks by segmenting management traffic from operational traffic, and ensuring that management traffic only comes from the OoB communication path.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Since 2017, the FBI has received numerous reports on credential stuffing attacksa against US financial institutions, collectively detailing nearly 50,000 account compromises. The victims included banks, financial services providers, insurance companies, and investment. During this timeframe, the FBI noted many reports on attacks targeting application programming interfaces (APIs), which are less likely to require multi-factor authentication (MFA). The attackers masqueraded as legitimate account holders and bank employees to submit fraudulent transactions, including money transfers, bill payments, and credit card reward points purchases. Credential stuffing also caused losses from business costs associated with customer notification, system downtime, and remediationi.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hardening network devices reduces the risk of unauthorized access into a network’s infrastructure. Vulnerabilities in device management and configurations present weaknesses for a malicious cyber actor to exploit in order to gain presence and maintain persistence within a network. Adversaries have shifted their focus from exclusively exploiting traditional endpoints to increasingly exploiting specialized and embedded devices, including routers and switches. They do this through manipulating weaknesses in configurations, controlling routing protocols, and implanting malware in the operating systems.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mobile devices store and share device geolocation data by design. This data is essential to device communications and provides features—such as mapping applications—that users consider indispensable. Mobile devices determine location through any combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) and wireless signals (e.g., cellular, wireless (Wi-Fi®1 ), or Bluetooth®2 (BT)). Location data can be extremely valuable and must be protected. It can reveal details about the number of users in a location, user and supply movements, daily routines (user and organizational), and can expose otherwise unknown associations between users and locations.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over recent months, cyber actors have demonstrated their continued willingness to conduct malicious cyber activity against Critical Infrastructure (CI) by exploiting Internet-accessible Operational Technology (OT) assets [1]. Due to the increase in adversary capabilities and activity, the criticality to U.S. national security and way of life, and the vulnerability of OT systems, civilian infrastructure makes attractive targets for foreign powers attempting to do harm to US interests or retaliate for perceived US aggression. OT assets are critical to the Department of Defense (DoD) mission and underpin essential National Security Systems (NSS) and services, as well as the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and other critical infrastructure. At this time of heightened tensions, it is critical that asset owners and operators of critical infrastructure take the following immediate steps to ensure resilience and safety of US systems should a time of crisis emerge in the near term. The National Security Agency along with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recommend that all DoD, NSS, DIB, and U.S. Critical Infrastructure facilities take immediate actions to secure their OT assets.

The FBI seeks to inform US companies in the healthcare, chemical, and finance sectors of potential targeting activity by the Chinese government against their business and operational components based in China. As early as March 2019, at least two Western companies operating in China detected malware that was delivered through Chinese vendors that were responsible for releasing tax software upgrades following changes in 2018 to China’s value-added tax (VAT). The malware launched a backdoor into victim systems, which the FBI assesses likely allows cyber actors to preposition to conduct remote code execution and exfiltration activities on the victim’s network.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cyber actors have exploited built-in network protocols, designed to reduce computational overhead of day-to-day system and operational functions, to conduct larger and more destructive distributed denial of service (DDoS) amplification attacks against US networks. A DDoS amplification attack occurs when an attacker sends a small number of requests to a server and the server responds with more numerous responses to the victim. Typically, the attacker spoofs the source Internet Protocol (IP) address to appear as if they are the victim, resulting in traffic that overwhelms victim resources. Cyber actors likely will increasingly abuse built-in network protocols. Such abuse likely will enable DDoS amplification attacks to be carried out with limited resources and result in significant disruptions and impact on the targets.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
While careful cloud adoption can enhance an organization’s security posture, cloud services can introduce risks that organizations should understand and address both during the procurement process and while operating in the cloud. Fully evaluating security implications when shifting resources to the cloud will help ensure continued resource availability and reduce risk of sensitive information exposures. To implement effective mitigations, organizations should consider cyber risks to cloud resources, just as they would in an on-premises environment.

Notice on Iranian Cyber Tactics and Techniques<a href="https://publications.bsafes.com/docs/fbi/pin-2020-0109-01-notice-on-iranian-cyber-tactics-and-techniques/"> Full Text</a>
</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The FBI assesses foreign cyber actors operating in the Islamic Republic of Iran, one of two nation-states known to have conducted destructive cyber attacks inside the United States, could potentially use a range of Computer Network Operations (CNO) against US-based networks in retaliation for last week’s strikes against Iranian military leadership. The FBI has observed an increase in Iranian cyber reconnaissance activity since last week’s strike. Among the most common and effective methods Iranian cyber actors use to conduct CNO are spearphishing, virtual private network (VPN) vulnerability targeting, and password spray attacks, which enable remote access and allow Iran to gather information to counter perceived threats to their regime. Businesses and individuals in the United States whom this activity may target include those involved in industries of interest to Iran, including academia, government, cleared defense contractors, and nongovernmental organizations focusing on Iranian issues.
