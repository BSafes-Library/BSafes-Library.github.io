•  CYBER AND TRIA: EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF AN “ACT OF TERRORISM” TO INCLUDE CYBER ATTACKS [HTML](https://papers.bsafes.com/docs/cybercrime/cyber-and-tria-expand-the-definition-of-an-act-of-terrorism-to-include-cyber-attacks/)
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The 9/11 terrorist attacks brought on financial losses that caused insurers and Congress to reevaluate how the United States approaches terrorism risk coverage. Congress quelled concerns of insurers evading coverage of future terrorist attacks by enacting the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act in 2002. This Note considers the difficulties presented by the out-of-date language employed by Congress in 2002 and proposes amendments so that the Act more clearly covers acts of cyberterrorism, which are ever-growing in their destructive potential.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The effects of identity theft can haunt data breach victims for years. Some victims report the need to constantly shut down fraudulent accounts. Likewise, some report countless fraudulent inquiries on their credit reports. Some victims even report fraudulent tax returns filed in their names. Many consumers believe there is not much they can do to protect their data in the first place.

</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Many online chat applications live in a grey area between the legitimate web and the dark net. The Telegram network in particular can aid criminal activities. Telegram hosts “chats” which consist of varied conversations and advertisements. These chats take place among automated “bots” and human users. Classifying legitimate activity from illegitimate activity can aid law enforcement in finding criminals. Social network analysis of Telegram chats presents a difficult problem. Users can change their username or create new accounts. Users involved in criminal activity often do this to obscure their identity. This makes establishing the unique identity behind a given username challenging. Thus we explored classifying users from their language usage in their chat messages.

“[T]here are only ‘two categories’ of companies affected by trade secret theft — ‘[T]hose [sic] that know they’ve been compromised and those that don’t know yet.’”  Whether you imagine a cyber thief subverting a company’s network defenses or an employee selling secret information to a competitor, trade secret theft is a real threat. The epidemic has ballooned to such proportions- $600 billion –that combatting trade secret theft enjoys bipartisan congressional support. Despite Congress’s best efforts, there is no evidence the bleeding has slowed, much less stopped.

In today’s world, where instant gratification is king and the majority craves being shocked and awed, stories that exploit the personal endeavors and escapades of our peers and superiors reign supreme. Of particular interest are those relating to sex; whether it’s the kinks of a congressman, the intimacies of an idol, or the extramarital affair of a neighbor, people love the nitty-gritty and no one is safe from the dissemination of these exceedingly private details. This includes the distribution of intimate photos and videos taken with or without the consent of the individual depicted.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In Industry of Anonymity: Inside the Business of Cybercrime, Jonathan Lusthaus attempts to demystify the increasingly sophisticated business of cybercrime and examine how it has matured into a large, profit-driven industry. Through interviews with hundreds of subjects involved in the cybercrime industry in varying capacities, Lusthaus has sought to draw a map that, by showing how seemingly disparate elements in the industry relate to one another, can better explain how the cybercrime industry functions. In particular, Lusthaus strives to produce a better understanding of the people behind cybercrime and the contexts in which they operate. By doing so, the book endeavors to lift the veil of anonymity that has historically hidden cybercrime offenders and their activities from public view.

• Cybersecurity of Smart Electric Vehicle Charging: A Power Grid Perspective [HTML](https://papers.bsafes.com/docs/electric-vehicle/cybersecurity-of-smart-electric-vehicle-charging-a-power-grid-perspective/)
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With the roll-out of electric vehicles (EVs), the automobile industry is transitioning away from conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles. As a result, the EV charging demand is continuously growing and to meet this growing demand, various types of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are being deployed for commercial and residential use. This nexus of EVs, EVCSs, and power grids creates complex cyber-physical interdependencies that can be maliciously exploited to damage each of these components. This paper describes and analyzes cyber vulnerabilities that arise at this nexus and points to the current and emerging gaps in the security of the EV charging ecosystem. These vulnerabilities must be addressed as the number of EVs continue to grow worldwide and their impact on the power grid becomes more viable. The purpose of this paper is to list and characterize all backdoors that can be exploited to seriously harm either EV and EVCS equipments, or power grid, or both. The presented issues and challenges intend to ignite research efforts on cybersecurity of smart EV charging and enhancing power grid resiliency against such demand-side cyberattacks in general.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As technology evolves, new outlets for interpersonal conflict and crime evolve with it. The law is notorious for its inability to keep pace with this evolution. This Comment focuses on one area that the law urgently needs to regulate—the dissemination of “revenge porn,” otherwise known as nonconsensual pornography. Currently, no federal law exists in the U.S. that criminalizes the dissemination of nonconsensual pornography. Most U.S. states have criminalized the offense, but with vastly different degrees of severity, resulting in legal inconsistencies and jurisdictional conflicts. This Comment proposes a federal solution to the dissemination of nonconsensual pornography that carefully balances the interests of victims with the variety of scenarios that may give rise to this crime.

Amidst the regular drumbeat of reports about Russian attempts to undermine U.S. democratic institutions from Twitter bots to cyber-attacks on Congressional candidates, it is easy to forget that the problem of election security is not isolated to the United States and extends far beyond safeguarding insecure voting machines. Consider Australia, which has long been grappling with repeated Chinese attempts to interfere with its political system. Yet Australia has taken a distinct approach in how it has sought to protect its democratic institutions, including reclassifying its political parties as “critical infrastructure,” a step that the U.S. government has yet to take despite repeated breaches at both the Democratic and Republican National Committees.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Military-grade cryptography has been widely available at no cost for personal and commercial use since the early 1990s. Since the introduction of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), more and more people encrypt files and devices, and we are now at the point where our smartphones are encrypted by default. While this ostensibly provides users with a high degree of privacy, compelling a user to provide a password has been interpreted by some courts as a violation of our Fifth Amendment protections, becoming an often insurmountable hurdle to law enforcement lawfully executing a search warrant. This paper will explore some of the issues around this complex legal and social issue, including the evolution in the use of digital cryptography and the evolving legal interpretations of privacy.

“A feminist assessment of social media, then, is an exploration of how communities form and interact in social media spaces as well as if values expressed via these participatory cultures align or misalign with feminist ethical criteria. Digital social media invite participation based on the values of openness, collaboration, and networking, which in theory align with feminist values such as access, cooperation, and inclusion. However, the opportunities social media platforms afford are increasingly shaped by the business models and algorithms behind them, not to mention the material biases users bring with them” (Ott, 2018)

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Intimate life is under constant surveillance. Firms track people’s periods, hot flashes, abortions, sexual assaults, sex toy use, sexual fantasies, and nude photos. Individuals hardly appreciate the extent of the monitoring, and even if they did, little can be done to curtail it. What is big business for firms is a big risk for individuals. The handling of intimate data undermines the values that sexual privacy secures—autonomy, dignity, intimacy, and equality. It can imperil people’s job, housing, insurance, and other crucial opportunities. More often, women and minorities shoulder a disproportionate amount of the burden.

• Articulating the Cloud: Understanding Data Centers, Renewable Energy, and Public Policy [HTML](https://papers.bsafes.com/docs/internet/articulating-the-cloud-understanding-data-centers-renewable-energy-and-public-policy/)
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Experts urge that drastic steps must be taken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions as the ongoing climate crisis worsens. Amid this, it is also important to understand the relationships between media infrastructures and the finite resources they require. This thesis goes beyond arguing that data centers are inherently unsustainable media infrastructures that consumers rely on to access the Internet and cloud storage. Instead, this thesis focuses on Google as an industry leading company in the United States to assess how the company understands their role in the climate crisis, and how they define renewable energy and sustainability. To do so, this thesis used critical discourse analysis of Google’s public-facing documents, government documents, and related joint reports between external research organizations and Google related to their data centers. The findings revealed the company defines sustainability as a commitment and company value, and that they have an immense renewable energy portfolio through additional acquisitions measures. Ultimately, this thesis argues that Google discursively positions themselves as corporately benevolent and masks retroactive sustainability in the guise of activism while simultaneously firing activist employees, having fossil fuel industry clientele, and financially contributing to anti-climate change organizations. This thesis contributes to important conversations related to media infrastructure sustainability, in particular emphasizing the complex tensions and dynamics at work to make banal technologies possible. It is important for consumers to understand the limitations and items lacking in corporate discourse to advocate for a more sustainable future for everyone.

Memes have become a staple of Internet culture. They provide a crucial form of cultural interchange by allowing billions to communicate and commiserate about all facets of life through the sharing of amusing and relatable phenomena. However, many memes are created from copyrighted images, making it unclear whether their use constitutes copyright infringement actionable by the original copyright owners. This Note considers memes in the context of U.S. copyright law and proposes that memes could be protected against copyright infringement by the fair use doctrine, which excuses infringement if the would-be infringer’s use is socially desirable and aligned with the basic aims of copyright law. To illustrate this, this Note analyzes the “typical meme” through a thorough examination of the four statutory factors of fair use.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Internet is essential for education, employment, information, and cultural and democratic participation. For tens of millions of people with disabilities in the United States, barriers to accessing the Internet—including the visual presentation of information to people who are blind or visually impaired, the aural presentation of information to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and the persistence of Internet technology, interfaces, and content without regard to prohibitive cognitive load for people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities—collectively pose one of the most significant civil rights issues of the information age. Yet disability law lacks a comprehensive theoretical approach for fully facilitating Internet accessibility. The prevailing doctrinal approach to Internet accessibility seeks to treat websites as metaphorical “places” subject to Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires places of public accommodations to be accessible to people with disabilities. While this place-centric approach to Title III has succeeded to a significant degree in making websites accessible over the last two decades, large swaths of the Internet—more broadly construed to include Internet technologies beyond websites—remain inaccessible to millions of people with a variety of disabilities.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We used in-depth interviews with 101 participants in the East York section of Toronto, Canada to understand how digital media affects social connectivity in general–and networked individualism in particular–for people at different stages of the life course. Although people of all ages intertwined their use of digital media with their face-to-face interactions, younger adults used more types of digital media and more diversified personal networks. People in different age-groups conserved media, tending to stick with the digital media they learned to use in earlier life stages. Approximately one-third of the participants were Networked Individuals: In each age-group, they were the most actively using digital media to maintain ties and to develop new ones. Another one-third were Socially Bounded, who often actively used digital media but kept their connectivity within a smaller set of social groups. The remaining one-third, who were Socially Limited, were the least likely to use digital media. Younger adults were the most likely to be Networked Individuals, leading us to wonder if the percentage of the population who are Bounded or Limited will decline over time.

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A robust public debate is currently underway about the responsibility of online platforms. We have long called for this discussion, but only recently has it been seriously taken up by legislators and the public. The debate begins with a basic question: should platforms should be responsible for user-generated content? If so, under what circumstances? What exactly would such responsibility look like? Under consideration is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act—a provision originally designed to encourage tech companies to clean up “offensive” online content. The public discourse around Section 230, however, is riddled with misconceptions. As an initial matter, many people who opine about the law are unfamiliar with its history, text, and application. This lack of knowledge impairs thoughtful evaluation of the law’s goals and how well they have been achieved. Accordingly, Part I of this Article sets the stage with a description of Section 230—its legislative history and purpose, its interpretation in the courts, and the problems that current judicial interpretation raises. A second, and related, major source of misunderstanding is the conflation of Section 230 and the First Amendment. Part II details how this conflation distorts discussion in three ways: it assumes all Internet activity is protected speech; it treats private actors as though they were government actors; and it presumes that regulation will inevitably result in less speech. These distortions must be addressed in order to pave the way for clear-eyed policy reform. Part III offers potential solutions to help Section 230 achieve its legitimate goals.

• Revenge Porn and the First Amendment - Should Nonconsensual Distribution of Sexually Explicit Images Receive Constitutional Protection? [HTML](https://papers.bsafes.com/docs/privacy/revenge-porn-and-the-first-amendmen/)
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Like many issues related to relationships and sexuality, “revenge porn” has become more complicated—and its consequences more sinister—thanks to twenty-first century technology. Revenge porn, often referred to as nonconsensual pornography, involves the publication or distribution of sexually explicit images without the subject’s consent. This may include images obtained without consent, as well as images initially obtained with consent—often within the context of an intimate relationship—but later shared broadly or used as blackmail. The issue received increased public attention after a 2014 incident in which a hacker accessed and leaked sexually explicit photos of several celebrities. But celebrities are far from the only victims: a 2016 study found that roughly one in twenty-five Americans have been threatened with or been the victim of nonconsensual image sharing.
