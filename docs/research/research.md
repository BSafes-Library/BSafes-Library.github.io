  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The effects of identity theft can haunt data breach victims for years. Some victims report the need to constantly shut down fraudulent accounts. Likewise, some report countless fraudulent inquiries on their credit reports. Some victims even report fraudulent tax returns filed in their names. Many consumers believe there is not much they can do to protect their data in the first place.

In today’s world, where instant gratification is king and the majority craves being shocked and awed, stories that exploit the personal endeavors and escapades of our peers and superiors reign supreme. Of particular interest are those relating to sex; whether it’s the kinks of a congressman, the intimacies of an idol, or the extramarital affair of a neighbor, people love the nitty-gritty and no one is safe from the dissemination of these exceedingly private details. This includes the distribution of intimate photos and videos taken with or without the consent of the individual depicted.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In Industry of Anonymity: Inside the Business of Cybercrime, Jonathan Lusthaus attempts to demystify the increasingly sophisticated business of cybercrime and examine how it has matured into a large, profit-driven industry. Through interviews with hundreds of subjects involved in the cybercrime industry in varying capacities, Lusthaus has sought to draw a map that, by showing how seemingly disparate elements in the industry relate to one another, can better explain how the cybercrime industry functions. In particular, Lusthaus strives to produce a better understanding of the people behind cybercrime and the contexts in which they operate. By doing so, the book endeavors to lift the veil of anonymity that has historically hidden cybercrime offenders and their activities from public view.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Amidst the regular drumbeat of reports about Russian attempts to undermine U.S. democratic institutions from Twitter bots to cyber-attacks on Congressional candidates, it is easy to forget that the problem of election security is not isolated to the United States and extends far beyond safeguarding insecure voting machines. Consider Australia, which has long been grappling with repeated Chinese attempts to interfere with its political system. Yet Australia has taken a distinct approach in how it has sought to protect its democratic institutions, including reclassifying its political parties as “critical infrastructure,” a step that the U.S. government has yet to take despite repeated breaches at both the Democratic and Republican National Committees.

• Cryptography, Passwords, Privacy, and the Fifth Amendment, August , 2020 [HTML](https://papers.bsafes.com/docs/encryption/cryptography-passwords-privacy-and-the-fifth-amendment/)
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Military-grade cryptography has been widely available at no cost for personal and commercial use since the early 1990s. Since the introduction of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), more and more people encrypt files and devices, and we are now at the point where our smartphones are encrypted by default. While this ostensibly provides users with a high degree of privacy, compelling a user to provide a password has been interpreted by some courts as a violation of our Fifth Amendment protections, becoming an often insurmountable hurdle to law enforcement lawfully executing a search warrant. This paper will explore some of the issues around this complex legal and social issue, including the evolution in the use of digital cryptography and the evolving legal interpretations of privacy.

• A New Compact for Sexual Privacy, June, 2020 [HTML](https://papers.bsafes.com/docs/privacy/a-new-compact-for-sexual-privacy/)
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Intimate life is under constant surveillance. Firms track people’s periods, hot flashes, abortions, sexual assaults, sex toy use, sexual fantasies, and nude photos. Individuals hardly appreciate the extent of the monitoring, and even if they did, little can be done to curtail it. What is big business for firms is a big risk for individuals. The handling of intimate data undermines the values that sexual privacy secures—autonomy, dignity, intimacy, and equality. It can imperil people’s job, housing, insurance, and other crucial opportunities. More often, women and minorities shoulder a disproportionate amount of the burden.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
JACQUELINE KNIRNSCHILD: This thesis is a collection of creative non-fiction essays that offers a collage of ethnography, reportage and memoir. The Red Swimsuit blurs the lines between what is considered social science, journalism and art. These essays will become part of a booklength work of creative non-fiction that will explore what it’s like to grow up as a woman in a globalized world wrought with social media, hookup culture and cross-cultural interactions. The Red Swimsuit provides first-hand experience, reflexive narration, and reflection on life as a member of Generation Z, also known as iGen. (Under the direction of Beth Ann Fennelly)

• Internet Architecture and Disability, April 5, 2020 [HTML](https://papers.bsafes.com/docs/internet/internet-architecture-and-disability/)
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Internet is essential for education, employment, information, and cultural and democratic participation. For tens of millions of people with disabilities in the United States, barriers to accessing the Internet—including the visual presentation of information to people who are blind or visually impaired, the aural presentation of information to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and the persistence of Internet technology, interfaces, and content without regard to prohibitive cognitive load for people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities—collectively pose one of the most significant civil rights issues of the information age. Yet disability law lacks a comprehensive theoretical approach for fully facilitating Internet accessibility. The prevailing doctrinal approach to Internet accessibility seeks to treat websites as metaphorical “places” subject to Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires places of public accommodations to be accessible to people with disabilities. While this place-centric approach to Title III has succeeded to a significant degree in making websites accessible over the last two decades, large swaths of the Internet—more broadly construed to include Internet technologies beyond websites—remain inaccessible to millions of people with a variety of disabilities.
