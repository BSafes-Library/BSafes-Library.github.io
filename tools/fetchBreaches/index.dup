On September 21, 2020, a 1919ic employee discovered some unusual activity on their 1919ic work computer. We immediately began investigating and retained a third party forensic expert to assist. During our investigation, we learned that an unauthorized user gained access to 1919ic’s computer systems, which are operated by a third-party Managed IT services firm with oversight by 1919ic’s internal technology team. During the forensic analysis, 1919ic was able to quickly take steps to prevent further unauthorized access and secure our systems. At this time, we do not have any indication that your information was accessed or misused. However, because we deeply value you and are committed to transparency, we wanted to make you aware of this incident.

We are contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred on August 25, 2020 at Cantella & Co., Inc. This incident involved email threads which were used to entice recipients to open an attachment containing malware. Malware is a term used to describe any kind of computer software with malicious intent. Recipients of these malicious emails opened the attachments, believing them to be from a credible source, which in turn installed the malware. Unfortunately, this malware is very difficult to detect, and almost none of the virus scanners available out there today are able to do so. In total, we identified 23 infected computers across our organization. Regrettably, some of your personal information may have been contained within these infected computers as many of the emails were internal and therefore deemed to be secure. If you are an entity client, this may include your authorized persons’ personal information. It is important to note that we have no evidence to support any attempts to misuse private client information thus far, but there is a possibility that your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information may have been potentially exposed to others. We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. As such, we are providing you with complimentary credit monitoring for the next two years and we ask that you enroll by following the steps outline below.

Blackbaud notified us that it discovered a ransomware attack on its systems around May 20, 2020. Blackbaud retained independent forensics experts and notified law enforcement. Shortly after the discovery, Blackbaud expelled the cybercriminal from its system.  However, Blackbaud determined that before being locked out the cybercriminal had removed a copy of the Foundation’s backup file maintained on Blackbaud’s servers, which contained your personal information. Blackbaud believes the cybercriminal accessed this file initially on February 7, 2020 and retained access until May 20, 2020. We understand that Blackbaud confirmed that the backup file copy had been destroyed. Based on the nature of the incident, Blackbaud’s research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigations, Blackbaud does not believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was misused, or will be further disseminated.

Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident.

We care about the security of your personal information, and we are writing to tell you that we have discovered evidence of unauthorized access to some of your personal information. On October 9, 2020, we were alerted to unusual activity involving our website, thenorthface.com, that prompted us to investigate immediately. Following a careful investigation, we concluded that a credential stuffing attack had been launched against our website on October 8 and 9, 2020. A “credential stuffing attack” is a specific type of cybersecurity attack in which the attacker uses account authentication credentials (e.g., email addresses/usernames and passwords) stolen from another source, such as a breach of another company or website, to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Credential stuffing attacks can occur when individuals use the same authentication credentials on multiple websites, which is why we encourage you to use a unique password on thenorthface.com.<br><br>  

Based on our investigation, we believe that the attacker previously gained access to your email address and password from another source (not from The North Face) and subsequently used those same credentials to access your account on thenorthface.com.<br><br>  

We do not believe that the attacker obtained information from us that would require us to notify you of a data security breach under applicable law, but we are notifying you of the incident voluntarily, out of an abundance of caution.<br><br>

Sometime between May 26 and June 5, 2020, various groups of individuals broke into multiple Walgreens stores and forced entry into the secured pharmacy at select locations, including your preferred Walgreens. Among the many items stolen were certain items containing health-related information —such as filled prescriptions waiting for customer pick up and paper records. This included a very limited number of hard drives that were attached to stolen cash registers. These hard drives contained information about certain recent pharmacy purchases completed at that cash register. One pharmacy automation device that stored prescription labeling information for a short time period was also involved.  Between May 26 and June 5, Walgreens discovered customer information was impacted. We later determined that one or more of the items described above may have contained your information. We wanted to alert you to this fact.

 In May 2020, Blackbaud experienced a ransomware incident that impacted certain systems within the Blackbaud environment. As a result of this incident, certain Blackbaud systems were encrypted and a Blackbaud database backup file including VSAC data was removed from the Blackbaud environment by an unauthorized actor.

On April 27, 2020 Woodland was notified by Aeries Software, Inc. (“Aeries”), a third-party student data management vendor, of a potential data incident affecting Aeries’ school district clients. While Aeries indicated it found no evidence to suggest that any data was specifically accessed, that type of activity cannot be ruled out with certainty.
