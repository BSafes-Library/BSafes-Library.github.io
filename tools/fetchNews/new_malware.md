Necro Python Malware Upgrades With New Exploits and Crypto Mining Capabilities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/necro-python-malware-upgrades-with-new.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New upgrades have been made to a Python-based "self-replicating, polymorphic bot" called Necro in what's seen as an attempt to improve its chances of infecting vulnerable systems and evading detection.  "Although the bot was originally discovered earlier this year, the latest activity shows numerous changes to the bot, ranging from different command-and-control (C2) communications and the addition of new exploits for spreading, most notably vulnerabilities in VMWare vSphere, SCO OpenServer, Vesta Control Panel and SMB-based exploits that were not present in the earlier iterations of the code," researchers from Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive published today.   Said to be in development as far back as 2015,&nbsp; Necro &nbsp;(aka N3Cr0m0rPh) targets both Linux and Windows devices, with heightened activity observed at the start of the year as part of a malware campaign dubbed " FreakOut " that was found exploiting&nbsp; vulnerabilities &nbsp;in network-attached storage (

Researchers have disclosed significant security weaknesses in popular software applications that could be abused to deactivate their protections and take control of allow-listed applications to perform nefarious operations on behalf of the malware to defeat anti-ransomware defenses.  The twin attacks,&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;by academics from the University of Luxembourg and the University of London, are aimed at circumventing the protected folder feature offered by antivirus programs to encrypt files (aka "Cut-and-Mouse") and disabling their real-time protection by simulating mouse "click" events (aka "Ghost Control").  "Antivirus software providers always offer high levels of security, and they are an essential element in the everyday struggle against criminals,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Prof. Gabriele Lenzini, chief scientist at the Interdisciplinary Center for Security, Reliability, and Trust at the University of Luxembourg.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new backdoor program capable of stealing user login credentials, device information and executing arbitrary commands on Linux systems.  The malware dropper has been dubbed " Facefish " by Qihoo 360 NETLAB team owing its capabilities to deliver different rootkits at different times and the use of&nbsp; Blowfish &nbsp;cipher to encrypt communications to the attacker-controlled server.  "Facefish consists of 2 parts, Dropper and Rootkit, and its main function is determined by the Rootkit module, which works at the&nbsp; Ring 3 &nbsp;layer and is loaded using the&nbsp; LD_PRELOAD &nbsp;feature to steal user login credentials by hooking ssh/sshd program related functions, and it also supports some backdoor functions," the researchers&nbsp; said .

Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday publicized the disruption of a "clever" malvertising network targeting AnyDesk that delivered a weaponized installer of the remote desktop software via rogue Google ads that appeared in the search engine results pages.  The campaign, which is believed to have begun as early as April 21, 2021, involves a malicious file that masquerades as a setup executable for AnyDesk (AnyDeskSetup.exe), which, upon execution, downloads a PowerShell implant to amass and exfiltrate system information.  "The script had some obfuscation and multiple functions that resembled an implant as well as a hardcoded domain (zoomstatistic[.]com) to 'POST' reconnaissance information such as user name, hostname, operating system, IP address and the current process name," researchers from Crowdstrike&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis.

Researchers on Tuesday disclosed a new espionage campaign that resorts to destructive data-wiping attacks targeting Israeli entities at least since December 2020 that camouflage the malicious activity as ransomware extortions.  Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne attributed the attacks to a nation-state actor affiliated with Iran it tracks under the moniker "Agrius."  "An analysis of what at first sight appeared to be a ransomware attack revealed new variants of wipers that were deployed in a set of destructive attacks against Israeli targets," the researchers&nbsp; said . "The operators behind the attacks intentionally masked their activity as ransomware attacks, an uncommon behavior for financially motivated groups."   The group's modus operandi involves deploying a custom .NET malware called Apostle that has evolved to become fully functional ransomware, supplanting its prior wiper capabilities, while some of the attacks have been carried out using a second

Microsoft on Thursday warned of a "massive email campaign" that's pushing a Java-based STRRAT malware to steal confidential data from infected systems while disguising itself as a ransomware infection.  "This RAT is infamous for its ransomware-like behavior of appending the file name extension .crimson to files without actually encrypting them," the Microsoft Security Intelligence team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a series of tweets.  The new wave of attacks, which the company spotted last week, commences with spam emails sent from compromised email accounts with "Outgoing Payments" in the subject line, luring the recipients into opening malicious PDF documents that claim to be remittances, but in reality, connect to a rogue domain to download the STRRAT malware.   Besides establishing connections to a command-and-control server during execution, the malware comes with a range of features that allow it to collect browser passwords, log keystrokes, and run remote command

Experts Warn About Ongoing AutoHotkey-Based Malware Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/experts-warn-about-ongoing-autohotkey.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered an ongoing malware campaign that heavily relies on AutoHotkey (AHK) scripting language to deliver multiple remote access trojans (RAT) such as Revenge RAT, LimeRAT, AsyncRAT, Houdini, and Vjw0rm on target Windows systems.  At least four different versions of the campaign have been spotted starting February 2021, according to researchers from Morphisec Labs.  "The RAT delivery campaign starts from an AutoHotKey (AHK) compiled script," the researchers&nbsp; noted . "This is a standalone executable that contains the following: the AHK interpreter, the AHK script, and any files it has incorporated via the&nbsp; FileInstall &nbsp;command. In this campaign, the attackers incorporate malicious scripts/executables alongside a legitimate application to disguise their intentions."   AutoHotkey is an open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows that's meant to provide easy hotkeys for macro-creation and software automation, enablin

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors are abusing Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) to filelessly deliver remote access trojans and password-stealing malware on targeted Windows systems.  The actively ongoing campaign is said to have emerged last month, researchers from cybersecurity firm Anomali&nbsp; said &nbsp;on Thursday, adding the malicious build files came embedded with encoded executables and shellcode that deploy&nbsp; backdoors , allowing the adversaries to take control of the victims' machines and steal sensitive information.  MSBuild is an open-source build tool for .NET and Visual Studio developed by Microsoft that allows for compiling source code, packaging, testing, deploying applications.   In using MSBuild to filelessly compromise a machine, the idea is to stay under the radar and thwart detection, as such malware makes use of a legitimate application to load the attack code into memory, thereby leaving no traces of infection on the system and giving attackers a high level of stealth.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed a new Android trojan that hijacks users' credentials and SMS messages to facilitate fraudulent activities against banks in Spain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands.  Called " TeaBot " (or Anatsa), the malware is said to be in its early stages of development, with malicious attacks targeting financial apps commencing in late March 2021, followed by a rash of infections in the first week of May against Belgium and Netherlands banks. The first signs of TeaBot activity emerged in January.   "The main goal of TeaBot is stealing victim's credentials and SMS messages for enabling frauds scenarios against a predefined list of banks," Italian cybersecurity, and online fraud prevention firm Cleafy said in a Monday write-up.

New Stealthy Rootkit Infiltrated Networks of High-Profile Organizations<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/new-stealthy-rootkit-infiltrated.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor with the capabilities to evolve and tailor its toolset to target environments infiltrated high-profile organizations in Asia and Africa with an evasive Windows rootkit since at least 2018.  Called&nbsp; 'Moriya ,' the malware is a "passive backdoor which allows attackers to inspect all incoming traffic to the infected machine, filter out packets that are marked as designated for the malware and respond to them," said Kaspersky researchers Mark Lechtik and Giampaolo Dedola in a Thursday deep-dive.  The Russian cybersecurity firm termed the ongoing espionage campaign&nbsp; 'TunnelSnake .' Based on telemetry analysis, less than 10 victims around the world have been targeted to date, with the most prominent victims being two large diplomatic entities in Southeast Asia and Africa. All the other victims were located in South Asia.   The first reports of Moriya emerged last November when Kaspersky said it discovered the stealthy implant in the networks

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers on Tuesday disclosed a novel malware that uses a variety of tricks to stay under the radar and evade detection, while stealthily capable of executing arbitrary commands on infected systems.  Called 'Pingback,' the Windows malware leverages Internet Control Message Protocol ( ICMP ) tunneling for covert bot communications, allowing the adversary to utilize ICMP packets to piggyback attack code, according to an analysis  published today by Trustwave.   Pingback (" oci.dll ") achieves this by getting loaded through a legitimate service called&nbsp; MSDTC &nbsp;(Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator) — a component responsible for handling database operations that are distributed over multiple machines — by taking advantage of a method called&nbsp; DLL search order hijacking , which involves using a genuine application to preload a malicious DLL file.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed a new malspam campaign distributing a fresh variant of a malware loader called 'Buer' written in Rust, illustrating how adversaries are constantly honing their malware toolsets to evade analysis.  Dubbed "RustyBuer," the malware is distributed via emails masquerading as shipping notices from DHL Support, and is said to have affected no fewer than 200 organizations across more than 50 verticals since early April.  "The new Buer variant is written in Rust, an efficient and easy-to-use programming language that is becoming increasingly popular," Proofpoint researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report shared with The Hacker News. "Rewriting the malware in Rust enables the threat actor to better evade existing Buer detection capabilities."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously undocumented Linux malware with backdoor capabilities has managed to stay under the radar for about three years, allowing the threat actor behind the operation to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive information from infected systems.  Dubbed " RotaJakiro " by researchers from Qihoo 360 NETLAB, the backdoor targets Linux X64 machines, and is so named after the fact that "the family uses rotate encryption and behaves differently for root/non-root accounts when executing."   The findings come from an analysis of a&nbsp; malware sample &nbsp;it detected on March 25, although early versions appear to have been uploaded to VirusTotal as early as May 2018. A&nbsp; total &nbsp;of&nbsp; four &nbsp; samples &nbsp;have been found to date on the database, all of which remain undetected by most anti-malware engines. As of writing, only seven security vendors flag the latest version of the malware as malicious.   "At the functional level, RotaJakiro first determines whether the user is root or non-

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Attention, Android users! A banking malware capable of stealing sensitive information is "spreading rapidly" across Europe, with the U.S. likely to be the next target.  According to a new analysis by&nbsp; Proofpoint , the threat actors behind FluBot (aka&nbsp; Cabassous ) have branched out beyond Spain to target the U.K., Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Poland. The English-language campaign alone has been observed to make use of more than 700 unique domains, infecting about 7,000 devices in the U.K.  In addition, German and English-language SMS messages were found being sent to U.S. users from Europe, which Proofpoint suspects could be the result of malware propagating via contact lists stored on compromised phones. A concerted campaign aimed at the U.S. is yet to be detected.   FluBot, a nascent entry in the banking trojan landscape, began its operations late last year, with campaigns leveraging the malware infecting more than 60,000 users in Spain, according to an analysis published b

Researchers from the University of Minnesota apologized to the maintainers of Linux Kernel Project on Saturday for intentionally including vulnerabilities in the project's code, which led to the school being banned from contributing to the open-source project in the future.  "While our goal was to improve the security of Linux, we now understand that it was hurtful to the community to make it a subject of our research, and to waste its effort reviewing these patches without its knowledge or permission," assistant professor Kangjie Lu, along with graduate students Qiushi Wu and Aditya Pakki,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an email.  "We did that because we knew we could not ask the maintainers of Linux for permission, or they would be on the lookout for the hypocrite patches," they added.   The apology comes over a study into what's called "hypocrite commits," which was&nbsp; published &nbsp;earlier this February.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Emotet, the notorious email-based Windows malware behind several botnet-driven spam campaigns and ransomware attacks, was automatically wiped from infected computers en masse following a European law enforcement operation.  The development comes three months after a coordinated disruption of Emotet as part of " Operation Ladybird " to seize control of servers used to run and maintain the malware network. The orchestrated effort saw at least 700 servers associated with the botnet's infrastructure neutered from the inside, thus preventing further exploitation.  Law enforcement authorities from the Netherlands, Germany, the U.S., U.K., France, Lithuania, Canada, and Ukraine were involved in the international action.   Previously, the Dutch police, which seized two central servers located in the country, said it had deployed a software update to counter the threat posed by Emotet effectively. "All infected computer systems will automatically retrieve the update there, a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Facebook on Wednesday said it took steps to dismantle malicious activities perpetrated by two state-sponsored hacking groups operating out of Palestine that abused its platform to distribute malware.  The social media giant attributed the attacks to a network connected to the Preventive Security Service ( PSS ), the security apparatus of the State of Palestine, and another threat actor known as Arid Viper (aka Desert Falcon and APT-C-23), the latter of which is alleged to be connected to the cyber arm of Hamas.  The two digital espionage campaigns, active in 2019 and 2020, exploited a range of devices and platforms, such as Android, iOS, and Windows, with the PSS cluster primarily targeting domestic audiences in Palestine. The other set of attacks went after users in the Palestinian territories and Syria and, to a lesser extent Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, and Libya.   Both the groups appear to have leveraged the platform as a springboard to launch a variety of social engineering attacks in

Malware That Spreads Via Xcode Projects Now Targeting Apple's M1-based Macs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/malware-spreads-via-xcode-projects-now.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A Mac malware campaign targeting Xcode developers has been retooled to add support for Apple's new M1 chips and expand its features to steal confidential information from cryptocurrency apps.  XCSSET came into the spotlight in&nbsp; August 2020 &nbsp;after it was found to spread via modified Xcode IDE projects, which, upon the building, were configured to execute the payload. The malware repackages payload modules to imitate legitimate Mac apps, which are ultimately responsible for infecting local Xcode projects and injecting the main payload to execute when the compromised project builds.   XCSSET modules come with the capabilities to steal credentials, capture screenshots, inject malicious JavaScript into websites, plunder user data from different apps, and even encrypt files for a ransom.&nbsp;  Then in March 2021, Kaspersky researchers&nbsp; uncovered &nbsp;XCSSET samples compiled for the new Apple M1 chips, suggesting that the malware campaign was not only ongoing but also that adversaries are&nbsp; activ

A malicious program intended to cause havoc with IT systems—malware—is becoming more and more sophisticated every year. The year 2021 is no exception, as recent trends indicate that several&nbsp; new variants of malware &nbsp;are making their way into the world of cybersecurity.  While smarter security solutions are popping up, modern malware still eludes and challenges cybersecurity experts.&nbsp;  The evolution of malware has infected everything from personal computers to industrial units since the 70s. Cybersecurity firm&nbsp; FireEye's network was attacked &nbsp;in 2020 by hackers with the most sophisticated form of hacking i.e., supply chain.  This hacking team demonstrated world-class capabilities to disregard security tools and forensic examination, proving that anybody can be hacked. Also, the year 2021 is already witnessing a bump in&nbsp; COVID-19 vaccine-related phishing attacks .&nbsp;  Let's take a look at the trends that forecast an increase in malware attacks:  COVID-19 and Work-from-Home (WFH)

Microsoft has warned organizations of a "unique" attack campaign that abuses contact forms published on websites to deliver malicious links to businesses via emails containing fake legal threats, in what's yet another instance of adversaries abusing legitimate infrastructure to mount evasive campaigns that bypass security protections.

IceID &nbsp;is a Windows-based banking trojan that's used for reconnaissance and exfiltration of banking credentials, alongside features that allow it to connect to a remote command-and-control (C2) server to deploy additional payloads such as ransomware and malware capable of performing hands-on-keyboard attacks, stealing credentials, and moving laterally across affecte

A previously undocumented malware downloader has been spotted in the wild in phishing attacks to deploy credential stealers and other malicious payloads.

"Saint Bot is a downloader that appeared quite recently, and slowly is getting momentum. It was seen dropping stealers (i.e.&nbsp; Taurus &nbsp;Stealer) or further loaders ( example ), yet its design allows [it] to utilize it for distributing any kind of malware," said Aleksandra "Hasherezade" Doniec, a threat intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes.   "Furthermore, Saint Bot employs a wide variety of techniques which, although not novel, indicate some level of sophistication considering its relatively new appearance."

Gigaset has revealed a malware infection discovered in its Android devices was the result of a compromise of a server belonging to an external update service provider.

The German manufacturer of telecommunications devices said it took steps to alert the update service provider of the issue, following which further infections were prevented on April 7.  "Measures have been taken to automatically rid infected devices of the malware. In order for this to happen the devices must be connected to the internet (WLAN, WiFi or mobile data). We also recommend connecting the devices to their chargers. Affected devices should automatically be freed from the malware within 8 hours," the comp

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An Iranian threat actor has unleashed a new cyberespionage campaign against a possible Lebanese target with a backdoor capable of exfiltrating sensitive information from compromised systems.  Cybersecurity firm Check Point attributed the operation to APT34, citing similarities with previous techniques used by the threat actor as well as based on its pattern of victimology.  APT34 &nbsp;(aka OilRig) is known for its reconnaissance campaigns aligned with the strategic interests of Iran, primarily hitting financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications industries in the Middle East.   The group typically resorts to targeting individuals through the use of booby-trapped job offer documents, delivered directly to the victims via LinkedIn messages, and the latest campaign is no exception, although the mode of delivery remains unclear as yet.  The Word document analyzed by Check Point — which was&nbsp; uploaded &nbsp;to VirusTotal from Lebanon on January 10 — claims to offer information abo

Besides masquerading as a Netflix app, the malicious "FlixOnline" app also requests intrusive permissions that allow it to create fake Login screens for other apps, with the goal of stealing credentials and gain access to

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what appears to be a fresh twist in Android malware, users of Gigaset mobile devices are encountering unwanted apps that are being downloaded and installed through a pre-installed system update app.  "The culprit installing these malware apps is the Update app, package name&nbsp; com.redstone.ota.ui , which is a pre-installed system app," Malwarebytes researcher Nathan Collier&nbsp; said . "This app is not only the mobile device's system updater, but also an auto installer known as Android/PUP.Riskware.Autoins.Redstone."  The development was&nbsp; first reported &nbsp;by German author and blogger Günter Born last week.   While the issue seems to be mainly affecting Gigaset phones, devices from a handful of other manufacturers appear to be impacted as well. The full list of devices that come with the pre-installed auto-installer includes Gigaset GS270, Gigaset GS160, Siemens GS270, Siemens GS160, Alps P40pro, and Alps S20pro+.  According to Malwarebytes, the Update app installs

Experts uncover a new Banking Trojan targeting Latin American users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/experts-uncover-new-banking-trojan.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers on Tuesday revealed details of a new banking trojan targeting corporate users in Brazil at least since 2019 across various sectors such as engineering, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, finance, transportation, and government.  Dubbed " Janeleiro " by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, the malware aims to disguise its true intent via lookalike pop-up windows that are designed to resemble the websites of some of the biggest banks in the country, including Itaú Unibanco, Santander, Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econômica Federal, and Banco Bradesco.  "These pop-ups contain fake forms, aiming to trick the malware's victims into entering their banking credentials and personal information that the malware captures and exfiltrates to its [command-and-control] servers," ESET researchers Facundo Muñoz and Matías Porolli said in a write-up.   This modus operandi is not new to banking trojans. In August 2020, ESET uncovered a Latin American (LATAM) banking trojan call

Hackers Targeting professionals With 'more_eggs' Malware via LinkedIn Job Offers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/hackers-targeting-professionals-with.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new spear-phishing campaign is targeting professionals on LinkedIn with weaponized job offers in an attempt to infect targets with a sophisticated backdoor trojan called "more_eggs."  To increase the odds of success, the phishing lures take advantage of malicious ZIP archive files that have the same name as that of the victims' job titles taken from their LinkedIn profiles.  "For example, if the LinkedIn member's job is listed as Senior Account Executive—International Freight the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account Executive—International Freight position (note the 'position' added to the end)," cybersecurity firm eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU)&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis. "Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiates the stealthy installation of the fileless backdoor, more_eggs."   Campaigns delivering more_eggs using the&nbsp; same modus operandi &nbsp;have been spotted at least since 2018, with the backdo

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Purple Fox , a Windows malware previously known for infecting machines by using exploit kits and phishing emails, has now added a new technique to its arsenal that gives it worm-like propagation capabilities.  The ongoing campaign makes use of a "novel spreading technique via indiscriminate port scanning and exploitation of exposed SMB services with weak passwords and hashes," according to&nbsp; Guardicore researchers , who say the attacks have spiked by about 600% since May 2020.  A total of 90,000 incidents have been spotted through the rest of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.   First discovered in March 2018,&nbsp;Purple Fox&nbsp;is distributed in the form of malicious ".msi" payloads hosted on nearly 2,000 compromised Windows servers that, in turn, download and execute a component with&nbsp; rootkit capabilities , which enables the threat actors to hide the malware on the machine and make it easy to evade detection.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday disclosed a new attack wherein threat actors are leveraging Xcode as an attack vector to compromise Apple platform developers with a backdoor, adding to a growing trend that involves targeting developers and researchers with malicious attacks.  Dubbed "XcodeSpy," the trojanized Xcode project is a tainted version of a legitimate, open-source project available on GitHub called TabBarInteraction that's used by developers to animate iOS tab bars based on user interaction.  "XcodeSpy is a malicious Xcode project that installs a custom variant of the EggShell backdoor on the developer's macOS computer along with a persistence mechanism," SentinelOne researchers&nbsp; said .   Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS, used to develop software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unwrapped an "interesting email campaign" undertaken by a threat actor that has taken to distributing a new malware written in&nbsp; Nim &nbsp;programming language.  Dubbed " NimzaLoader " by Proofpoint researchers, the development marks one of the rare instances of Nim malware discovered in the threat landscape.  "Malware developers may choose to use a rare programming language to avoid detection, as reverse engineers may not be familiar with Nim's implementation, or focused on developing detection for it, and therefore tools and sandboxes may struggle to analyze samples of it," the researchers said.   Proofpoint is tracking the operators of the campaign under the moniker "TA800," who, they say, started distributing NimzaLoader starting February 3, 2021. Prior to the latest raft of activity, TA800 is known to have predominantly used&nbsp;BazaLoader&nbsp;since April 2020.   While APT28 has been previously linked to delivering&nbsp; Zeb

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednesday shed light on a new sophisticated backdoor targeting Linux endpoints and servers that's believed to be the work of Chinese nation-state actors.  Dubbed " RedXOR " by Intezer, the backdoor masquerades as a polkit daemon, with similarities found between the malware and those previously associated with the&nbsp; Winnti Umbrella &nbsp;(or Axiom) threat group such as ​PWNLNX, ​XOR.DDOS​ and Groundhog.  RedXOR's name comes from the fact that it encodes its network data with a scheme based on XOR, and that it's compiled with a legacy&nbsp; GCC compiler &nbsp;on an old release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, suggesting that the malware is deployed in targeted attacks against legacy Linux systems.   Intezer said&nbsp; two &nbsp; samples &nbsp;of the malware were uploaded from Indonesia and Taiwan around Feb. 23-24, both countries that are known to be singled out by China-based threat groups.  Aside from the overlaps in terms of the overall flow and functionalities and th

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new malware dropper contained in as many as 9 Android apps distributed via Google Play Store that deploys a second stage malware capable of gaining intrusive access to the financial accounts of victims as well as full control of their devices.

The apps that were used for the campaign include Cake VPN, Pacific VPN, eVPN, BeatPlayer, QR/Barcode Scanner MAX, Music Player, tooltipnatorlibrary, and QRecorder.

Malware Can Exploit New Flaw in Intel CPUs to Launch Side-Channel Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/malware-can-exploit-new-flaw-in-intel.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new research has yielded yet another means to pilfer sensitive data by exploiting what's the first "on-chip, cross-core" side-channel in Intel Coffee Lake and Skylake processors.  Published by a group of academics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the&nbsp; findings &nbsp;are expected to be presented at the USENIX Security Symposium coming this August.  While information leakage attacks targeting the CPU microarchitecture have been previously demonstrated to break the isolation between user applications and the operating system, allowing a malicious program to access memory used by other programs (e.g., Meltdown and Spectre), the new attack leverages a contention on the ring interconnect.  SoC&nbsp; Ring interconnect &nbsp;is an on-die bus arranged in a ring topology which enables intra-process communication between different components (aka agents) such as the cores, the last level cache (LLC), the graphics unit, and the system agent that are housed inside the CPU.

A framework notorious for delivering a banking Trojan has received a facelift to deploy a wider range of malware, including ransomware payloads.  "The&nbsp; Gootkit &nbsp;malware family has been around more than half a decade – a mature Trojan with functionality centered around banking credential theft," Sophos researchers Gabor Szappanos and Andrew Brandt&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published today.  "In recent years, almost as much effort has gone into improvement of its delivery method as has gone into the NodeJS-based malware itself."  Dubbed "Gootloader," the expanded malware delivery system comes amid a surge in the number of infections targeting users in France, Germany, South Korea, and the U.S.   First documented in 2014, Gootkit is a Javascript-based malware platform capable of carrying out an array of covert activities, including web injection, capturing keystrokes, taking screenshots, recording videos, as well as email and password theft.

A credential stealer infamous for targeting Windows systems has resurfaced in a new phishing campaign that aims to steal credentials from Microsoft Outlook, Google Chrome, and instant messenger apps.  Primarily directed against users in Turkey, Latvia, and Italy starting mid-January, the attacks involve the use of&nbsp; MassLogger &nbsp;— a .NET-based malware with capabilities to hinder static analysis — building on similar campaigns undertaken by the same actor against users in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Hungary, Estonia, Romania, and Spain in September, October, and November 2020.  MassLogger was first spotted in the wild last April, but the presence of a new variant implies malware authors are constantly retooling their arsenal to evade detection and monetize them.   "Although operations of the Masslogger trojan have been previously documented, we found the new campaign notable for using the compiled HTML file format to start the infection chain," researchers with Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;on W

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the first malware samples tailored to run natively on Apple's M1 chips has been discovered, suggesting a new development that indicates that bad actors have begun adapting malicious software to target the company's latest generation of Macs powered by its own processors.  While the transition to Apple silicon has necessitated developers to build new versions of their apps to ensure better performance and compatibility, malware authors are now undertaking similar steps to build malware that are capable of executing natively on Apple's new M1 systems, according to macOS Security researcher Patrick Wardle.  Wardle detailed a Safari adware extension called GoSearch22 that was originally written to run on Intel x86 chips but has since been ported to run on ARM-based M1 chips. The rogue extension, which is a variant of the Pirrit advertising malware, was first seen in the wild on November 23, 2020, according to a sample&nbsp; uploaded &nbsp;to VirusTotal on December 27.

A previously known Windows remote access Trojan (RAT) with credential-stealing capabilities has now expanded its scope to set its sights on users of Android devices to further the attacker's espionage motives.  "The developers of&nbsp; LodaRAT &nbsp;have added Android as a targeted platform," Cisco Talos researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "A new iteration of LodaRAT for Windows has been identified with improved sound recording capabilities."  Kasablanca, the group behind the malware, is said to have deployed the new RAT in an ongoing hybrid campaign targeting Bangladeshi users, the researchers noted.  The reason why Bangladesh-based organizations have been specifically singled out for this campaign remains unclear, as is the identity of the threat actor.   First documented in May 2017 by&nbsp; Proofpoint , Loda is an AutoIt malware typically delivered via phishing lures that's equipped to run a wide range of commands designed to record audio, video, and capture oth

"This extension contains malware,"&nbsp; read &nbsp;a terse notification from Google, but it has since emerged that the add-on stealthily added features that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code from a remote server, including tracking users online and committing advertising fraud.  "The old maintainer appears to have sold the extension to parties unknown, who have malicious intent to exploit the users of this extension in advertising fraud, tracking, and more," Calum McConnell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a GitHub post.   The extension, which had more than two million installs before it was disabled, would suspend tabs that aren't in use, replacing them with a blank gray screen until they were reloaded upon returning to the tabs in question.

High-performance computing clusters belonging to university networks as well as servers associated with government agencies, endpoint security vendors, and internet service providers have been targeted by a newly discovered backdoor that gives attackers the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the systems remotely.  Cybersecurity firm ESET named the malware " Kobalos " — a nod to a " mischievous creature " of the same name from Greek mythology — for its "tiny code size and many tricks."  "Kobalos is a generic backdoor in the sense that it contains broad commands that don't reveal the intent of the attackers," researchers Marc-Etienne M. Léveillé and Ignacio Sanmillan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "In short, Kobalos grants remote access to the file system, provides the ability to spawn terminal sessions, and allows proxying connections to other Kobalos-infected servers."

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers on Tuesday uncovered new delivery and evasion techniques adopted by Agent Tesla remote access trojan (RAT) to get around defense barriers and monitor its victims.  Typically spread through&nbsp;social engineering&nbsp;lures, the Windows spyware not only now targets Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface ( AMSI ) in an attempt to defeat endpoint protection software, it also employs a multi-stage installation process and makes use of Tor and Telegram messaging API to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server.  Cybersecurity firm Sophos , which observed two versions of Agent Tesla — version 2 and version 3 — currently in the wild, said the changes are yet another sign of Agent Tesla's constant evolution designed to make a sandbox and static analysis more difficult.   "The differences we see between v2 and v3 of Agent Tesla appear to be focused on improving the success rate of the malware against sandbox defenses and malware scanners, and on providing more

Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed a new supply chain attack compromising the update mechanism of NoxPlayer, a free Android emulator for PCs and Macs.  Dubbed " Operation NightScout " by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, the highly-targeted surveillance campaign involved distributing three different malware families via tailored malicious updates to selected victims based in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.  NoxPlayer, developed by Hong Kong-based BigNox, is an Android emulator that allows users to play mobile games on PC, with support for keyboard, gamepad, script recording, and multiple instances. It is&nbsp; estimated &nbsp;to have over 150 million users in more than 150 countries.   First signs of the ongoing attack are said to have originated around September 2020, from when the compromise continued until "explicitly malicious activity" was uncovered this week, prompting ESET to report the incident to BigNox.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially-motivated threat actor notorious for its cryptojacking attacks has leveraged a revised version of their malware to target cloud infrastructures using vulnerabilities in web server technologies, according to new research.  Deployed by the China-based cybercrime group&nbsp; Rocke , the Pro-Ocean cryptojacking malware now comes with improved rootkit and worm capabilities, as well as harbors new evasion tactics to sidestep cybersecurity companies' detection methods, Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up.   "Pro-Ocean uses known vulnerabilities to target cloud applications," the researchers detailed. "In our analysis, we found Pro-Ocean targeting Apache ActiveMQ ( CVE-2016-3088 ), Oracle WebLogic ( CVE-2017-10271 ) and Redis (unsecure instances)."  "Once installed, the malware kills any process that uses the CPU heavily, so that it's able to use 100% of the CPU and mine Monero efficiently."  First documented

Beware — A New Wormable Android Malware Spreading Through WhatsApp<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/beware-new-wormable-android-malware.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered Android malware has been found to propagate itself through WhatsApp messages to other contacts in order to expand what appears to be an adware campaign.  "This malware spreads via victim's WhatsApp by automatically replying to any received WhatsApp message notification with a link to [a] malicious Huawei Mobile app," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko  said.  The link to the fake Huawei Mobile app, upon clicking, redirects users to a lookalike Google Play Store website.  Once installed, the wormable app prompts victims to grant it notification access, which is then abused to carry out the wormable attack.   Specifically, it leverages WhatApp's quick reply feature — which is used to respond to incoming messages directly from the notifications — to send out a reply to a received message automatically.  Besides requesting permissions to read notifications, the app also requests intrusive access to run in the background as well as to draw over other apps,

MrbMiner Crypto-Mining Malware Links to Iranian Software Company<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/mrbminer-crypto-mining-malware-links-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A relatively new crypto-mining malware that surfaced last year and infected thousands of Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) databases has now been linked to a small software development company based in Iran.  The attribution was made possible due to an operational security oversight, said researchers from cybersecurity firm Sophos, that led to the company's name inadvertently making its way into the cryptominer code.  First documented by Chinese tech giant Tencent last September,&nbsp; MrbMiner &nbsp;was found to target internet-facing MSSQL servers with the goal of installing a cryptominer, which hijacks the processing power of the systems to mine Monero and funnel them into accounts controlled by the attackers.  The name "MrbMiner" comes after one of the domains used by the group to host their malicious mining software.   "In many ways, MrbMiner's operations appear typical of most cryptominer attacks we've seen targeting internet-facing servers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Gabor Szappa

Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a fourth new malware strain—designed to spread the malware onto other computers in victims' networks—which was deployed as part of the&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack &nbsp;disclosed late last year.  Dubbed "Raindrop" by Broadcom-owned Symantec, the malware joins the likes of other malicious implants such as&nbsp; Sunspot , Sunburst (or Solorigate), and Teardrop that were stealthily delivered to enterprise networks.   The latest finding comes amid a continued probe into the breach, suspected to be of&nbsp; Russian origin , that has claimed a number of U.S. government agencies and private sector companies.  "The discovery of Raindrop is a significant step in our investigation of the SolarWinds attacks as it provides further insights into post-compromise activity at organizations of interest to the attackers," Symantec researchers&nbsp; said .

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing malware campaign has been found exploiting recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Linux devices to co-opt the systems into an&nbsp; IRC botnet &nbsp;for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and mining Monero cryptocurrency.  The attacks involve a new malware variant called " FreakOut " that leverages newly patched flaws in TerraMaster, Laminas Project (formerly Zend Framework), and Liferay Portal, according to Check Point Research's new analysis published  today and shared with The Hacker News.   Attributing the malware to be the work of a long-time cybercrime hacker — who goes by the aliases Fl0urite and Freak on HackForums and Pastebin as early as 2015 — the researchers said the flaws —&nbsp; CVE-2020-28188 ,&nbsp; CVE-2021-3007 , and&nbsp; CVE-2020-7961 &nbsp;— were weaponized to inject and execute malicious commands in the server.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a series of attacks by a threat actor of Chinese origin that has targeted organizations in Russia and Hong Kong with malware — including a previously undocumented backdoor.  Attributing the campaign to&nbsp; Winnti &nbsp;(or APT41), Positive Technologies dated the first attack to May 12, 2020, when the APT used LNK shortcuts to extract and run the malware payload. A second attack detected on May 30 used a malicious RAR archive file consisting of shortcuts to two bait PDF documents claimed to be a curriculum vitae and an IELTS certificate.   The shortcuts themselves contain links to pages hosted on Zeplin, a legitimate collaboration tool for designers and developers that are used to fetch the final-stage malware that, in turn, includes a shellcode loader ("svchast.exe") and a backdoor called&nbsp; Crosswalk &nbsp;("3t54dE3r.tmp").  Crosswalk, first documented by FireEye in 2017, is a bare-bones modular backdoor capable of carrying out system r

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers took the wraps off an ongoing surveillance campaign directed against Colombian government institutions and private companies in the energy and metallurgical industries.  In a report published by ESET on Tuesday, the Slovak internet security company said the attacks — dubbed " Operation Spalax " — began in 2020, with the modus operandi sharing some similarities to an APT group targeting the country since at least April 2018, but also different in other ways.  The overlaps come in the form of phishing emails, which have similar topics and pretend to come from some of the same entities that were used in a February 2019 operation disclosed by&nbsp; QiAnXin researchers , and subdomain names used for command-and-control (C2) servers.   However, the two campaigns diverge in the attachments used for phishing emails, the remote access trojans (RATs) deployed, and the C2 infrastructure employed to fetch the malware dropped.  The attack chain begins with the target

Cybersecurity researchers have exposed the operations of an Android malware vendor who teamed up with a second threat actor to market and sell a remote access Trojan (RAT) capable of device takeover and exfiltration of photos, locations, contacts, and messages from popular apps such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Skype, Telegram, Kik, Line, and Google Messages.  The vendor, who goes by the name of " Triangulum " in a number of darknet forums, is alleged to be a 25-year-old man of Indian origin, with the individual opening up shop to sell the malware three years ago on June 10, 2017, according to an analysis published by Check Point  Research today.  "The product was a mobile RAT, targeting Android devices and capable of exfiltration of sensitive data from a C&amp;C server, destroying local data – even deleting the entire OS, at times," the researchers said.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the investigation into the SolarWinds supply-chain attack continues, cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a third malware strain that was deployed into the build environment to inject the backdoor into the company's Orion network monitoring platform.  Called " Sunspot ," the backdoor adds to a growing list of previously disclosed malicious software such as Sunburst and Teardrop.  "This highly sophisticated and novel code was designed to inject the Sunburst malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion Platform without arousing the suspicion of our software development and build teams," SolarWinds' new CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna&nbsp; explained .   While&nbsp; preliminary evidence &nbsp;found that operators behind the espionage campaign managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the Sunburst backdoor, the latest findings reveal a new timeline that establishes the first breach of

Cybersecurity researchers, for the first time, may have found a potential connection between the backdoor used in&nbsp; the SolarWinds hack &nbsp;to a previously known malware strain.  In new&nbsp; research &nbsp;published by Kaspersky researchers today, the cybersecurity firm said it discovered several features that overlap with another backdoor known as&nbsp; Kazuar , a .NET-based malware first documented by Palo Alto Networks in 2017.  Disclosed early last month, the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;was notable for its scale and stealth, with the attackers leveraging the trust associated with SolarWinds Orion software to infiltrate government agencies and other companies so as to deploy a custom malware codenamed "Sunburst."  Shared Features Between Sunburst and Kazuar  Attribution for the SolarWinds supply-chain compromise has been difficult in part due to little-to-no clues linking the attack infrastructure to previous campaigns or other well-known threat groups.

Cybesecurity researchers today revealed  a new malspam campaign that distributes a remote access Trojan (RAT) by purporting to contain a sex scandal video of U.S. President Donald Trump.  The emails, which carry with the subject line "GOOD LOAN OFFER!!," come attached with a Java archive (JAR) file called "TRUMP_SEX_SCANDAL_VIDEO.jar," which, when downloaded, installs Qua or Quaverse RAT ( QRAT ) onto the infiltrated system.  "We suspect that the bad guys are attempting to ride the frenzy brought about by the recently concluded Presidential elections since the filename they used on the attachment is totally unrelated to the email's theme," Trustwave's Senior Security Researcher Diana Lopera said in a write-up published today.   The latest campaign is a variant of the Windows-based QRAT downloader Trustwave researchers&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;in August.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers today revealed a wide-ranging scam targeting cryptocurrency users that began as early as January last year to distribute trojanized applications to install a previously undetected remote access tool on target systems.  Called ElectroRAT  by Intezer, the RAT is written from ground-up in Golang and designed to target multiple operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.&nbsp;  The apps are developed using the open-source Electron cross-platform desktop app framework.  "ElectroRAT is the latest example of attackers using Golang to develop multi-platform malware and evade most antivirus engines," the researchers said .   "It is common to see various information stealers trying to collect private keys to access victims wallets. However, it is rare to see tools written from scratch and targeting multiple operating systems for these purposes."  The campaign, first detected in December, is believed to have claimed over 6,500 victims based on th

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors have been discovered distributing a new credential stealer written in AutoHotkey (AHK) scripting language as part of an ongoing campaign that started early 2020.  Customers of financial institutions in the US and Canada are among the primary targets for credential exfiltration, with a specific focus on banks such as Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Canada, HSBC, Alterna Bank, Capital One, Manulife, and EQ Bank. Also included in the list is an Indian banking firm ICICI Bank.  AutoHotkey &nbsp;is an open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows aimed at providing easy hotkeys for macro-creation and software automation that allows users to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application.   The multi-stage infection chain commences with a malware-laced Excel file that's embedded with a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)&nbsp; AutoOpen &nbsp;macro, which is subsequently used to drop and execute the downloader client script ("adb.ahk") via a legitimate portable AHK

The information security news cycle went into overdrive yesterday afternoon. First, Reuters revealed that the Commerce and Treasury departments suffered significant intrusions. The Washington Post soon followed up with multiple sources attributing the attack to the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVR—in particular, a portion of the SVR known as Cozy Bear—although there is no official attribution yet. Within a few hours, FireEye and Microsoft announced that this was a “supply chain attack” involving SolarWinds Orion software, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive. Today, it turns out that the attackers also compromised the Department of Homeland Security. SolarWinds revealed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the breach may affect 18,000 customers.
