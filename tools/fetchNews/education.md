Securing SaaS Apps — CASB vs. SSPM<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/securing-saas-apps-casb-vs-sspm.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There is often confusion between Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) and SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) solutions, as both are designed to address security issues within SaaS applications. CASBs protect sensitive data by implementing multiple security policy enforcements to safeguard critical data. For identifying and classifying sensitive information, like Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Intellectual Property (IP), and business records, CASBs definitely help.&nbsp;  However, as the number of SaaS apps increase, the amount of misconfigurations and possible exposure widens and cannot be mitigated by CASBs. These solutions act as a link between users and cloud service providers and can identify issues across various cloud environments. Where CASBs fall short is that they identify breaches&nbsp; after &nbsp;they happen.  When it comes to getting full visibility and control over the organization's SaaS apps, an SSPM solution would be the better choice, as the security team can e

A Guide to Shift Away from Legacy Authentication Protocols in Microsoft 365<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/a-guide-to-shift-away-from-legacy.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft 365 (M365), formerly called Office 365 (O365), is Microsoft's cloud strategy flagship product with major changes ahead, such as the deprecation of their legacy authentication protocols.  Often stored on or saved to the device, Basic Authentication protocols rely on sending usernames and passwords with every request, increasing the risk of attackers capturing users' credentials, particularly if not TLS protected. Basic Authentication, while necessary for companies using legacy software, is unable to enforce MFA and is superseded by Modern Authentication.  The legacy settings have been on Microsoft's radar to fix for years. In 2018,&nbsp; Microsoft announced&nbsp; it would introduce a series of changes — and ultimately deprecation — to its authentication controls as a means to help organizations mitigate the risk. These changes were set to take place over a number of years, and in September 2021,&nbsp; they announced &nbsp;that they will begin to permanently disable Basic Auth in all

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the side effects of today's cyber security landscape is the overwhelming volume of data security teams must aggregate and parse. Lean security teams don't have it any easier, and the problem is compounded if they must do it manually. Data and log management are essential for organizations to gain real-time transparency and visibility into security events.&nbsp;  XDR provider Cynet has offered up a new guide ( read it here ) that helps lean organizations understand the importance of centralized log management (CLM). The truth is that even the most well-stocked and staffed teams would have trouble manually handling their log management needs, which is why organizations are increasingly going the automated route.&nbsp;  On top of the efficiency of automation, CLM gives organizations much greater visibility into their environment and security events that impact them. However, the benefits of deploying CLM tools and reducing the level of human intervention in log management and analysis are m

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An effective cybersecurity strategy can be challenging to implement correctly and often involves many layers of security. Part of a robust security strategy involves performing what is known as a penetration test (pen test). The penetration test helps to discover vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your security defenses before the bad guys discover these. They can also help validate remedial efforts and solutions put in place to overcome previously discovered security vulnerabilities.&nbsp;  Let's look more closely at the pen test. What is included in a penetration test? How are they performed, and by whom? What steps should be taken after a penetration test?  What is a penetration test? 1 — Simulated cyberattack   A penetration test is, for all practical purposes, a simulated cyberattack on your business. However, it is carried out by the "good guys."

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Patching really, really matters – patching is what keeps technology solutions from becoming like big blocks of Swiss cheese, with endless security vulnerabilities punching hole after hole into critical solutions.  But anyone who's spent any amount of time maintaining systems will know that patching is often easier said than done.  Yes, in some instances, you can just run a command line to install that patch, and that's it. These instances are increasingly rare though – given the complexity of the technology environment, you're more likely faced with a complex process to achieve patching best practice.  In this article, we'll outline why database patching matters (yes, databases are vulnerable too!), explain what the problem is with patching databases, and point to a novel solution that takes the pain out of database patching.  Watch out – your database services are vulnerable too  We know that database services are critical – databases underpin IT operations in countle

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cloud security is the umbrella that holds within it: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. Gartner created the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) category for solutions that continuously assess security risk and manage the SaaS applications' security posture. With enterprises having 1,000 or more employees relying on dozens to hundreds of apps, the need for deep visibility and remediation for SaaS security settings is only getting more critical.&nbsp;  The top pain points for SaaS security stem from:   Lack of control &nbsp;over the growing SaaS app estate  Lack of governance in the lifecycle &nbsp;of SaaS apps: from purchase to deployment, operation and maintenance  Lack of visibility &nbsp;of all the configurations in SaaS app estate  Skills gap &nbsp;in ever-evolving, accelerating, complex cloud security&nbsp;  Laborious and&nbsp; overwhelming workload&nbsp; to stay on top of hundreds to thousands (to tens of thousands) of settings and permissions.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The Software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry has gone from novelty to an integral part of today's business world in just a few years. While the benefits to most organizations are clear – more efficiency, greater productivity, and accessibility – the risks that the SaaS model poses are starting to become visible. It's not an overstatement to say that most companies today run on SaaS. This poses an increasing challenge to their security teams.&nbsp;  A new guide from XDR and SSPM provider Cynet, titled The Guide for Reducing SaaS Applications Risk for Lean IT Security Teams ( download here ), breaks down exactly why SaaS ecosystems are so risky, and how security teams can mitigate those dangers.&nbsp;  Today, the average midsize company uses 185 SaaS apps. What this means is that the number of app-to-person connections has risen exponentially. Most midsize companies have nearly 4,406 touch points, creating an attack surface that requires significant resources to simply monitor. The risk of a digital

Although organizations commonly go to great lengths to address security vulnerabilities that may exist within their IT infrastructure, an organization's helpdesk might pose a bigger threat due to social engineering attacks.  Social engineering is "the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information," according to&nbsp; Webroot . There are many different types of social engineering schemes but one is area of vulnerability is how social engineering might be used against a helpdesk technician to steal a user's credentials.  The Process of Gaining Access With Social Engineering  The first step in such an attack is usually for the attacker to gather information about the organization that they are targeting. The attacker might start by using information that is freely available on the Internet to figure out who within the organization is most likely to have elevated permissions or access to sensitive information.

Communication is a vital skill for any leader at an organization, regardless of seniority. For security leaders, this goes double. Communicating clearly works on multiple levels. On the one hand, security leaders and CISOs must be able to communicate strategies clearly – instructions, incident response plans, and security policies. On the other, they must be able to communicate the importance of security and the value of having robust defenses to the C-level.&nbsp;  For CISOs and other security leaders, this latter skill is crucial but often overlooked or not prioritized. A new webinar: " How to ace your Infosec board deck ," looks to shed light on both the importance of being able to communicate clearly with management, and key strategies to do so effectively.

Security teams at mid-sized organizations are constantly faced with the question of "what does success look like?". At ActZero, their continued data-driven approach to cybersecurity invites them to grapple daily with measuring, evaluating, and validating the work they do on behalf of their customers.&nbsp;  Like most, they initially turned toward the standard metrics used in cybersecurity, built around a "Mean Time to X" (MTTX) formula, where X indicates a specific milestone in the attack lifecycle. In this formula, these milestones include factors like Detect, Alert, Respond, Recover, or even Remediate when necessary.  However, as they started to operationalize their unique&nbsp; AI and machine-learning approach , they realized that "speed" measures weren't giving them a holistic view of the story. More importantly, simply measuring just speed wasn't as applicable in an industry where machine-driven alerts and responses were happening in fractions of secon

How Does DMARC Prevent Phishing?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/how-does-dmarc-prevent-phishing.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
DMARC &nbsp;is a global standard for email authentication. It allows senders to verify that the email really comes from whom it claims to come from. This helps curb spam and phishing attacks, which are among the most prevalent cybercrimes of today. Gmail, Yahoo, and many other large email providers have implemented DMARC and praised its benefits in recent years.  If your company's domain name is bankofamerica.com, you do not want a cyber attacker to be able to send emails under that domain. This puts your brand reputation at risk and could potentially spread financial malware. The DMARC standard prevents this by checking whether emails are sent from an expected IP address or domain. It specifies how domains can be contacted if there are authentication or migration issues and provides forensic information so senders can monitor email traffic and quarantine suspicious emails.  What is a Phishing Attack?  Phishing is an attempt by cybercriminals to trick victims into giving away sensitive

For organizations that deal with the defense infrastructure – cybersecurity is more than just a buzzword.  Recently the US Department of Defense (DoD) created a new certification process – the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certificate (CMMC) – to ensure that all its vendors and contractors follow established best cybersecurity practices.  For organizations that work along the DoD supply chain, this means adhering to a strict regulatory framework, which can be quite complex. For one, must ensure that cybersecurity processes and practices are aligned with the type and sensitivity of the information that needs to be protected.  Even though the model is tiered (from "basic cybersecurity hygiene" to "advanced"), organizations will expend a significant effort to ensure they align with the compliance level appropriate for their contracts.  This is why one XDR provider has created a new guide to demonstrate how it helps organizations achieve CMMC compliance ( download the whitepaper here ).  T

Want to take advantage of excellent cloud services? Amazon Web Services may be the perfect solution, but don't forget about AWS security.  Whether you want to use AWS for a few things or everything, you need to protect access to it. Then you can make sure your business can run smoothly.  Read on to learn some important AWS security tips.  Use Multi-Factor authentication  When setting up your AWS security settings or adding new users, you should implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA relies on more than one login factor to grant you access to your account.  For example, when you log in to your account, the program might send a code to your mobile phone. Then you must verify that you have that phone and enter the code to access your account.  MFA is an excellent way to protect your data if someone figures out your username and password. This way, you can still have a layer of protection against the hacker.  Create strong passwords  Even with MFA, you should use strong, uni

April is usually a whirlwind month for the cybersecurity industry as it coincides with the release of the highly regarded and influential MITRE ATT&amp;CK test results. The ATT&amp;CK test measures cybersecurity platforms' abilities to detect and react to emulated, multistep attacks that can be used as a barometer of platform effectiveness.&nbsp;  This means that every cybersecurity vendor will be tripping over themselves to push out blog posts, webinars, press releases, and more touting how great their services are and how the results validate their products.  The result is a storm of spin and PR that is hard to navigate. An upcoming webinar offered by Cynet ( register here ) aims to help industry participants differentiate the spin from the real information when it comes to MITRE ATT&amp;CK results.

From&nbsp; Fortune 500 &nbsp;companies to startups, password-related breaches continue to spread seemingly unchecked.  As a result of the volume of data breaches and cybersecurity incidents, hackers now have access to a vast swathe of credentials that they can use to power various password-related attacks.  One example of this is credential stuffing attacks, which accounted for&nbsp; 1.5 billion &nbsp;incidents in the last quarter of 2020—a staggering 90% increase from Q1 2020.  The rapid pivot to digital in response to the pandemic has been a key contributor to the explosive growth in cybersecurity attacks. With organizations shifting more services online and investing in new applications that facilitate virtual interactions with employees and customers, this has changed the security landscape and presented an array of new avenues for hackers to exploit. However, in a rush to move everything online from mee

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ever-evolving and rampant form of cybercrime that targets emails as the potential medium to conduct fraud is known as Business Email Compromise.  Targeting commercial, government as well as non-profit organizations, BEC can lead to huge amounts of data loss, security breach, and compromised financial assets.  It is a common misconception that cybercriminals usually lay their focus on MNCs and enterprise-level organizations. SMEs these days are just as much a target to email fraud as the larger industry players.  How Can BEC Affect Organizations?&nbsp;  Examples of BEC include sophisticated social engineering attacks like phishing, CEO fraud, fake invoices, and email spoofing, to name a few. It can also be termed an impersonation attack wherein an attacker aims to defraud a company by posing people in authoritarian positions. Impersonating people like the CFO or CEO, a business partner, or anyone you will blindly place your trust in is what drives these attacks' success.  February of

What cybersecurity risks can relate to service accounts used in the environment? How can IT admins find weak or non-expiring passwords used in Active Directory for service accounts?

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platforms have received incredible attention as the platform for security teams.  Whether you're evaluating an EDR for the first time or looking to replace your EDR, as an information security professional, you need to be aware of the gaps prior already to implementation so you can best prepare how to close the gaps.  It's important to understand that each company is unique, and an EDR that a large company uses might not necessarily be the technology that works best when you are leading a small security team, even if you're within the same industry vertical.  Understanding your threat detection technology requirements based on your unique company characteristics will help you choose the right one.&nbsp;  The eBook and webinar "The Dark Side of EDR.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Today's admins certainly have plenty on their plates, and boosting ecosystem security remains a top priority. On-premises, and especially remote, accounts are gateways for accessing critical information.  Password management makes this possible. After all, authentication should ensure that a user is whom they claim to be. This initial layer of security is crucial for protecting one's entire infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the personal nature of passwords has its shortcomings. Passwords are easily forgotten. They may also be too simplistic; many companies don't enforce stringent password-creation requirements. This is where the Active Directory Password Policy comes in.  Additionally, the following is achievable:   Changing user passwords  Recording password changes and storing them within a history log   Active Directory accounts for any impactful changes across user accounts.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We likely all agree that 2020 was a year we won't soon forget - for many reasons. One area particularly impacted last year was (and continues to be) cybersecurity.&nbsp;  While Internet access allowed many businesses to continue functioning during the COVID-19 stay at home requirements, the unprecedented number of people accessing company assets remotely introduced many new challenges for cybersecurity professionals.  With a history of leveraging societal maladies to their advantage, cyber criminals leverage the confusion and unpreparedness created by the global pandemic in their cyber attacks.&nbsp;  In just the last two months of 2020, several high-profile organizations and government entities were successfully attacked using clever approaches that were overlooked by cybersecurity experts. Making sense of how attacks have changed and what new defensive strategies should be taken is no easy task. Cybersecurity company Cynet will help by reviewing the 2020 high profile attacks in depth and

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity is hard. For a CISO that faces the cyber threat landscape with a small security team, the challenge is compounded.  Compared to CISOs at large enterprises, CISOs small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have smaller teams with less expertise, smaller budgets for technology and outside services, and are more involved in day-to-day protection activities.  CISOs at SMEs are increasingly relying on virtual CISOs (vCISOs) to provide security expertise and guidance. vCISOs are typically former CISOs with years of experience building and managing information security programs across large and small organizations.  Helpful Advice for CISOs with Small Security Teams  Brian Haugli, a well-known vCISO in the US, recently collaborated with cybersecurity company&nbsp; Cynet —which provides autonomous XDR platforms tailored to small security teams—to provide a series of educational videos for CISOs with small security teams with relevant information about their challenges and possible solu
