How to Fight Business Email Compromise (BEC) with Email Authentication?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/how-to-fight-business-email-compromise.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ever-evolving and rampant form of cybercrime that targets emails as the potential medium to conduct fraud is known as Business Email Compromise.  Targeting commercial, government as well as non-profit organizations, BEC can lead to huge amounts of data loss, security breach, and compromised financial assets.  It is a common misconception that cybercriminals usually lay their focus on MNCs and enterprise-level organizations. SMEs these days are just as much a target to email fraud as the larger industry players.  How Can BEC Affect Organizations?&nbsp;  Examples of BEC include sophisticated social engineering attacks like phishing, CEO fraud, fake invoices, and email spoofing, to name a few. It can also be termed an impersonation attack wherein an attacker aims to defraud a company by posing people in authoritarian positions. Impersonating people like the CFO or CEO, a business partner, or anyone you will blindly place your trust in is what drives these attacks' success.  February of

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There are many different types of accounts in a typical Active Directory environment. These include user accounts, computer accounts, and a particular type of account called a&nbsp; service account .&nbsp;  A service account is a special type of account that serves a specific purpose for services, and ultimately, applications in the environment.  These special-purpose Active Directory accounts are also the subject of cybersecurity risks in the environment.  What is a service account? What special privileges does it have on local systems? What cybersecurity risks can relate to service accounts used in the environment? How can IT admins find weak or non-expiring passwords used in Active Directory for service accounts?  What is a Windows service?  As mentioned at the outset, specific Active Directory accounts serve different purposes in Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS).

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platforms have received incredible attention as the platform for security teams.  Whether you're evaluating an EDR for the first time or looking to replace your EDR, as an information security professional, you need to be aware of the gaps prior already to implementation so you can best prepare how to close the gaps.  It's important to understand that each company is unique, and an EDR that a large company uses might not necessarily be the technology that works best when you are leading a small security team, even if you're within the same industry vertical.  Understanding your threat detection technology requirements based on your unique company characteristics will help you choose the right one.&nbsp;  The eBook and webinar "The Dark Side of EDR.

Today's admins certainly have plenty on their plates, and boosting ecosystem security remains a top priority. On-premises, and especially remote, accounts are gateways for accessing critical information.  Password management makes this possible. After all, authentication should ensure that a user is whom they claim to be. This initial layer of security is crucial for protecting one's entire infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the personal nature of passwords has its shortcomings. Passwords are easily forgotten. They may also be too simplistic; many companies don't enforce stringent password-creation requirements. This is where the Active Directory Password Policy comes in.  Additionally, the following is achievable:   Changing user passwords  Recording password changes and storing them within a history log   Active Directory accounts for any impactful changes across user accounts.

We likely all agree that 2020 was a year we won't soon forget - for many reasons. One area particularly impacted last year was (and continues to be) cybersecurity.&nbsp;  While Internet access allowed many businesses to continue functioning during the COVID-19 stay at home requirements, the unprecedented number of people accessing company assets remotely introduced many new challenges for cybersecurity professionals.  With a history of leveraging societal maladies to their advantage, cyber criminals leverage the confusion and unpreparedness created by the global pandemic in their cyber attacks.&nbsp;  In just the last two months of 2020, several high-profile organizations and government entities were successfully attacked using clever approaches that were overlooked by cybersecurity experts. Making sense of how attacks have changed and what new defensive strategies should be taken is no easy task.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
