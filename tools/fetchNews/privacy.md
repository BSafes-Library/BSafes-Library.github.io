A New Spyware is Targeting Telegram and Psiphon VPN Users in Iran<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/a-new-spyware-is-targeting-telegram-and.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Threat actors with suspected ties to Iran have been found to leverage instant messaging and VPN apps like Telegram and Psiphon to install a Windows remote access trojan (RAT) capable of stealing sensitive information from targets' devices since at least 2015.  Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which pieced together the activity, attributed the campaign to an advanced persistent threat (APT) group it tracks as Ferocious Kitten, a group that has singled out Persian-speaking individuals allegedly based in the country while successfully operating under the radar.  "The targeting of Psiphon and Telegram, both of which are quite popular services in Iran, underlines the fact that the payloads were developed with the purpose of targeting Iranian users in mind," Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT)&nbsp; said .   "Moreover, the decoy content displayed by the malicious files often made use of political themes and involved images or videos of resistance bas

Mozilla Says Google's New Ad Tech—FLoC—Doesn't Protect User Privacy<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/mozilla-says-googles-new-ad.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google's upcoming plans to replace third-party cookies with a less invasive ad targeted mechanism have a number of issues that could defeat its privacy objectives and allow for significant linkability of user behavior, possibly even identifying individual users.  "FLoC is premised on a compelling idea: enable ad targeting without exposing users to risk,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Eric Rescorla, author of TLS standard and chief technology officer of Mozilla. "But the current design has a number of privacy properties that could create significant risks if it were to be widely deployed in its current form."  Short for Federated Learning of Cohorts,&nbsp; FLoC &nbsp;is part of Google's fledgling&nbsp; Privacy Sandbox &nbsp;initiative that aims to develop alternate solutions to satisfy cross-site use cases without resorting to third-party cookies or other opaque tracking mechanisms.  Essentially, FLoC allows marketers to guess users' interests without having to uniquely identify them, thereby eli

Hackers Can Exploit Samsung Pre-Installed Apps to Spy On Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/hackers-can-exploit-samsung-pre.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multiple critical security flaws have been disclosed in Samsung's pre-installed Android apps, which, if successfully exploited, could have allowed adversaries access to personal data without users' consent and take control of the devices.&nbsp;  "The impact of these bugs could have allowed an attacker to access and edit the victim's contacts, calls, SMS/MMS, install arbitrary apps with device administrator rights, or read and write arbitrary files on behalf of a system user which could change the device's settings," Sergey Toshin, founder of mobile security startup Oversecured,&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published Thursday.   Toshin reported the flaws to Samsung in February 2021, following which&nbsp; patches were issued &nbsp;by the manufacturer as part of its monthly security updates for April and May. The list of the seven vulnerabilities is as follows -   CVE-2021-25356 &nbsp;- third-party authentication bypass in Managed Provisioning  CVE-2021-25388 &nbsp;- Arbitrary app installation

In a huge sting operation, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Australian Federal Police (AFP) ran an "encrypted chat" service called&nbsp; ANoM &nbsp;for almost 3 years to intercept 27 million messages between criminal gang members globally.  Dubbed&nbsp; Operation Ironside &nbsp;(AFP),&nbsp; Operation Greenlight&nbsp; (Europol), and&nbsp; Operation Trojan Shield &nbsp;(FBI), the long-term covert probe into transnational and serious organized crime culminated in the arrests of 224 offenders on 526 charges in Australia, with 55 luxury vehicles, eight tons of cocaine, 22 tons of cannabis and cannabis resin, 250 firearms, and more than $48 million in various currencies and cryptocurrencies seized in raids around the world.&nbsp;  A total of more than 800 arrests have been reported across 18 countries, including New Zealand, Germany, and Sweden.

Google to Let Android Users Opt-Out to Stop Ads From Tracking Them<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/google-to-let-android-users-opt-out-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google is tightening the privacy practices that could make it harder for apps on Android phones and tablets to track users who have opted out of receiving personalized interest-based ads. The change will go into effect sometime in late 2021.  The development, which mirrors Apple's move to enable iPhone and iPad users to opt-out of ad tracking, was first&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by the Financial Times.&nbsp;  Once the revised policy goes live, Google is expected to completely cut off developers' access to the so-called "Advertising IDs," showing a "string of zeros" in its place. The Google Advertising ID (AAID), analogous to Apple's&nbsp; IDFA , is a unique device identifier that can be used by app developers to track users as they move between apps to target ads better and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.   "Starting in late 2021, when a user opts out of interest-based advertising or ads personalization, the advertising identifier will not be available,&amp;q

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) used a partnership with Denmark's foreign and military intelligence service to eavesdrop on top politicians and high-ranking officials in Germany, Sweden, Norway, and France by tapping into Danish underwater internet cables between 2012 and 2014.  Details of the covert wiretapping were&nbsp; broken &nbsp;by Copenhagen-based public broadcaster DR over the weekend based on interviews with nine unnamed sources, all of whom are said to have access to classified information held by the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste or FE).  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the then-German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the opposition leader at the time, Peer Steinbrück, are said to have been targeted through the Danish-American pact.

How Apple Gave Chinese Government Access to iCloud Data and Censored Apps<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/how-apple-gave-chinese-government.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In July 2018, when Guizhou-Cloud Big Data (GCBD)&nbsp; agreed to a deal &nbsp;with state-owned telco China Telecom to move users' iCloud data belonging to Apple's China-based users to the latter's servers, the shift raised concerns that it could make user data vulnerable to state surveillance.  Now, according to a&nbsp; deep-dive report &nbsp;from The New York Times, Apple's privacy and security concessions have "made it nearly impossible for the company to stop the Chinese government from gaining access to the emails, photos, documents, contacts and locations of millions of Chinese residents."  The revelations stand in stark contrast to Apple's commitment to privacy, while also highlighting a pattern of&nbsp; conceding &nbsp;to the&nbsp; demands &nbsp;of the Chinese government in order to continue its operations in the country.   Apple, in 2018, announced iCloud data of users in mainland China would move to a new data center in Guizhou province as part of a partnership with GCBD. The transitio

Over 25% Of Tor Exit Relays Spied On Users' Dark Web Activities<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/over-25-of-tor-exit-relays-are-spying.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An unknown threat actor managed to control more than 27% of the entire Tor network exit capacity in early February 2021, a new study on the dark web infrastructure revealed.  "The entity attacking Tor users is actively exploiting tor users since over a year and expanded the scale of their attacks to a new record level," an independent security researcher who goes by the name nusenu&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published on Sunday. "The average exit fraction this entity controlled was above 14% throughout the past 12 months."  It's the latest in a series of efforts undertaken to bring to light malicious Tor activity since&nbsp; December 2019 . The attacks, which are said to have begun in January 2020, were first&nbsp; documented and exposed &nbsp;by the same researcher in August 2020.   Tor is open-source software for enabling anonymous communication on the Internet. It obfuscates the source and destination of a web request by directing network traffic through a series of relays in or

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WhatsApp on Friday disclosed that it won't deactivate accounts of users who don't accept its&nbsp; new privacy policy &nbsp;rolling out on May 15, adding it will continue to keep reminding them to accept the new terms.  "No one will have their accounts deleted or lose functionality of WhatsApp on May 15 because of this update," the Facebook-owned messaging service&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement.  The move marks a turnaround from its previous stance earlier this year when the company outlined plans to make the accounts inaccessible completely should users choose not to comply with the data-sharing agreement and opt not to have their WhatsApp account information shared with Facebook.   "If you haven't accepted by [May 15], WhatsApp will not delete your account. However, you won't have full functionality of WhatsApp until you accept," the company had&nbsp; previously said .

Google has announced a number of user-facing and under-the-hood changes in an attempt to boost privacy and security, including rolling out two-factor authentication automatically to all eligible users and bringing iOS-styled privacy labels to Android app listings.

Researchers have discovered a new information-stealing trojan, which targets Android devices with an onslaught of data-exfiltration capabilities — from collecting browser searches to recording audio and phone calls.  While malware on Android has previously taken the guise of copycat apps, which go under names similar to legitimate pieces of software, this sophisticated new malicious app masquerades itself as a System Update application to take control of compromised devices.  "The spyware creates a notification if the device's screen is off when it receives a command using the Firebase messaging service," Zimperium researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Friday analysis. "The 'Searching for update..' is not a legitimate notification from the operating system, but the spyware."   Once installed, the sophisticated spyware campaign sets about its task by registering the device with a Firebase command-and-control (C2) server with information such as battery percentage, sto

Privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo called out rival Google for "spying" on users after the search giant updated its flagship app to spell out the exact kinds of information it collects for personalization and marketing purposes.  "After months of stalling, Google finally revealed how much personal data they collect in Chrome and the Google app. No wonder they wanted to hide it," the company&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a tweet. "Spying on users has nothing to do with building a great web browser or search engine."  The " privacy nutrition labels " are part of a new policy that&nbsp; went into effect &nbsp;on December 8, 2020, mandating app developers to disclose their data collection practices and help users understand how their personal information is put to use.

Signaling a major shift to its ads-driven business model, Google on Wednesday unequivocally stated it would not build alternate identifiers or tools to track users across multiple websites once it begins phasing out third-party tracking cookies from its Chrome browser by early 2022.  "Instead, our web products will be powered by privacy-preserving APIs which prevent individual tracking while still delivering results for advertisers and publishers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;David Temkin, Google's director of product management for ads privacy and trust.  "Advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers."  The changes, which could potentially reshape the advertising landscape, are expected only to cover websites visited via Chrome and do not extend to mobile apps.  At the same time, Google acknowledged that other companies might find alternative ways to track individual us

The Sunnyvale-based enterprise security company pinned the phishing operation on a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) it tracks as&nbsp; TA413 , which has been previously attributed to attacks against the Tibetan diaspora by leveraging&nbsp; COVID-themed lures &nbsp;to deliver the Sepulcher malware with the strategic goal of espionage and civil dissident surveillance.

Online Trackers Increasingly Switching to Invasive CNAME Cloaking Technique<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/online-trackers-increasingly-switching.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With browser makers steadily clamping down on third-party tracking, advertising technology companies are increasingly embracing a DNS technique to evade such defenses, thereby posing a threat to web security and privacy.  Called&nbsp; CNAME Cloaking , the practice of blurring the distinction between first-party and third-party cookies not only results in leaking sensitive private information without users' knowledge and consent but also "increases [the] web security threat surface," said a group of researchers Yana Dimova, Gunes Acar, Lukasz Olejnik, Wouter Joosen, and Tom Van Goethem in the latest research.  "This tracking scheme takes advantage of a CNAME record on a subdomain such that it is same-site to the including web site," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in the paper. "As such, defenses that block third-party cookies are rendered ineffective."  The findings are expected to be presented in July at the 21st Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2021

<details>

A new attack framework aims to infer keystrokes typed by a target user at the opposite end of a video conference call by simply leveraging the video feed to correlate observable body movements to the text being typed.  The research was undertaken by Mohd Sabra, and Murtuza Jadliwala from the University of Texas at San Antonio and Anindya Maiti from the University of Oklahoma, who say the attack can be extended beyond live video feeds to those streamed on YouTube and Twitch as long as a webcam's field-of-view captures the target user's visible upper body movements.  "With the recent ubiquity of video capturing hardware embedded in many consumer electronics, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, the threat of information leakage through visual channel[s] has amplified," the researchers&nbsp; said . "The adversary's goal is to utilize the observable upper body movements across all the recorded frames to infer the private text typed by the target."   To ach

Privacy Bug in Brave Browser Exposes Dark-Web Browsing History of Its Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/privacy-bug-in-brave-browser-exposes.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Brave has fixed a privacy issue in its browser that sent queries for .onion domains to public internet DNS resolvers rather than routing them through Tor nodes, thus exposing users' visits to dark web websites.  The bug was addressed in a hotfix&nbsp; release &nbsp;(V1.20.108) made available yesterday.  Brave ships with a built-in feature called " Private Window with Tor " that integrates the&nbsp; Tor &nbsp;anonymity network into the browser, allowing users to access .onion websites, which are hosted on the darknet, without revealing the IP address information to internet service providers (ISPs), Wi-Fi network providers, and the websites themselves. The feature was added in&nbsp; June 2018 .   This is achieved by relaying users' requests for an onion URL through a network of volunteer-run Tor nodes. At the same time, it's worth noting that the feature uses Tor just as a proxy and does not implement most of the privacy protections offered by Tor Browser.  But according to a report first

Apple's upcoming iOS 14.5 update will come with a new feature that will redirect all fraudulent website checks through its own proxy servers as a workaround to preserve user privacy and prevent leaking IP addresses to Google.  A built-in security-focused feature in the Safari browser, " Fraudulent Website Warning ," alerts users about dangerous websites that have been reported as deceptive, malicious, or harmful.  To achieve this, Apple relies on&nbsp; Google Safe Browsing &nbsp;— or Tencent Safe Browsing for users in Mainland China — a blocklist service that provides a list of URLs for web resources that contain malware or phishing content, to compare a hash prefix calculated from the website address and check if the website is fraudulent.   Any match against the database will prompt Safari to request Google or Tencent for the full list of URLs that match the hashed prefix and subsequently block the user's access to the site with a warning.  While the approach ensures that th

WhatsApp Delays Controversial 'Data-Sharing' Privacy Policy Update By 3 Months<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/whatsapp-delays-controversial-data.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WhatsApp said on Friday that it wouldn't enforce its recently announced&nbsp; controversial data sharing policy &nbsp;update&nbsp;until May 15.  Originally set to go into effect next month on February 8, the three-month delay comes following "a lot of misinformation" about a revision to its privacy policy that allows WhatsApp to share data with Facebook, sparking widespread concerns about the exact kind of information that will be shared under the incoming terms.  The Facebook-owned company has since repeatedly clarified that the update does not expand its ability to share personal user chats or other profile information with Facebook and is instead simply providing further transparency about how user data is collected and shared when using the messaging app to interact with businesses.   "The update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data," WhatsApp&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post.  "W

<details>

Cybersecurity researchers took the wraps off a new spyware operation targeting users in Pakistan that leverages trojanized versions of legitimate Android apps to carry out covert surveillance and espionage.  Designed to masquerade apps such as the Pakistan Citizen Porta l, a Muslim prayer-clock app called Pakistan Salat Time , Mobile Packages Pakistan , Registered SIMs Checker , and TPL Insurance , the malicious variants have been found to obfuscate their operations to stealthily download a payload in the form of an Android Dalvik executable (DEX) file.  "The DEX payload contains most of the malicious features, which include the ability to covertly exfiltrate sensitive data like the user's contact list and the full contents of SMS messages," Sophos  threat researchers Pankaj Kohli and Andrew Brandt said.  "The app then sends this information to one of a small number of command-and-control websites hosted on servers located in eastern Europe."   Interestingly, t
