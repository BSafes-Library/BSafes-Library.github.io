Google Will Use 'FLoC' for Ad Targeting Once 3rd-Party Cookies Are Dead<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/google-will-use-floc-for-ad-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>

Signaling a major shift to its ads-driven business model, Google on Wednesday unequivocally stated it would not build alternate identifiers or tools to track users across multiple websites once it begins phasing out third-party tracking cookies from its Chrome browser by early 2022.  "Instead, our web products will be powered by privacy-preserving APIs which prevent individual tracking while still delivering results for advertisers and publishers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;David Temkin, Google's director of product management for ads privacy and trust.  "Advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers."  The changes, which could potentially reshape the advertising landscape, are expected only to cover websites visited via Chrome and do not extend to mobile apps.  At the same time, Google acknowledged that other companies might find alternative ways to track individual us

Cybersecurity researchers today unwrapped a new campaign aimed at spying on vulnerable Tibetan communities globally by deploying a malicious Firefox extension on target systems.  "Threat actors aligned with the Chinese Communist Party's state interests delivered a customized malicious Mozilla Firefox browser extension that facilitated access and control of users' Gmail accounts," Proofpoint said in an analysis.  The Sunnyvale-based enterprise security company pinned the phishing operation on a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) it tracks as&nbsp; TA413 , which has been previously attributed to attacks against the Tibetan diaspora by leveraging&nbsp; COVID-themed lures &nbsp;to deliver the Sepulcher malware with the strategic goal of espionage and civil dissident surveillance.  The researchers said the attacks were detected in January and February 2021, a pattern that has continued since March 2020.   The infection chain begins with a phishing email impersonating the "Tib

Online Trackers Increasingly Switching to Invasive CNAME Cloaking Technique<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/online-trackers-increasingly-switching.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
With browser makers steadily clamping down on third-party tracking, advertising technology companies are increasingly embracing a DNS technique to evade such defenses, thereby posing a threat to web security and privacy.  Called&nbsp; CNAME Cloaking , the practice of blurring the distinction between first-party and third-party cookies not only results in leaking sensitive private information without users' knowledge and consent but also "increases [the] web security threat surface," said a group of researchers Yana Dimova, Gunes Acar, Lukasz Olejnik, Wouter Joosen, and Tom Van Goethem in the latest research.  "This tracking scheme takes advantage of a CNAME record on a subdomain such that it is same-site to the including web site," the researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in the paper. "As such, defenses that block third-party cookies are rendered ineffective."  The findings are expected to be presented in July at the 21st Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2021

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new attack framework aims to infer keystrokes typed by a target user at the opposite end of a video conference call by simply leveraging the video feed to correlate observable body movements to the text being typed.  The research was undertaken by Mohd Sabra, and Murtuza Jadliwala from the University of Texas at San Antonio and Anindya Maiti from the University of Oklahoma, who say the attack can be extended beyond live video feeds to those streamed on YouTube and Twitch as long as a webcam's field-of-view captures the target user's visible upper body movements.  "With the recent ubiquity of video capturing hardware embedded in many consumer electronics, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, the threat of information leakage through visual channel[s] has amplified," the researchers&nbsp; said . "The adversary's goal is to utilize the observable upper body movements across all the recorded frames to infer the private text typed by the target."   To ach

Privacy Bug in Brave Browser Exposes Dark-Web Browsing History of Its Users<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/privacy-bug-in-brave-browser-exposes.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Brave has fixed a privacy issue in its browser that sent queries for .onion domains to public internet DNS resolvers rather than routing them through Tor nodes, thus exposing users' visits to dark web websites.  The bug was addressed in a hotfix&nbsp; release &nbsp;(V1.20.108) made available yesterday.  Brave ships with a built-in feature called " Private Window with Tor " that integrates the&nbsp; Tor &nbsp;anonymity network into the browser, allowing users to access .onion websites, which are hosted on the darknet, without revealing the IP address information to internet service providers (ISPs), Wi-Fi network providers, and the websites themselves. The feature was added in&nbsp; June 2018 .   This is achieved by relaying users' requests for an onion URL through a network of volunteer-run Tor nodes. At the same time, it's worth noting that the feature uses Tor just as a proxy and does not implement most of the privacy protections offered by Tor Browser.  But according to a report first

Apple's upcoming iOS 14.5 update will come with a new feature that will redirect all fraudulent website checks through its own proxy servers as a workaround to preserve user privacy and prevent leaking IP addresses to Google.  A built-in security-focused feature in the Safari browser, " Fraudulent Website Warning ," alerts users about dangerous websites that have been reported as deceptive, malicious, or harmful.  To achieve this, Apple relies on&nbsp; Google Safe Browsing &nbsp;— or Tencent Safe Browsing for users in Mainland China — a blocklist service that provides a list of URLs for web resources that contain malware or phishing content, to compare a hash prefix calculated from the website address and check if the website is fraudulent.   Any match against the database will prompt Safari to request Google or Tencent for the full list of URLs that match the hashed prefix and subsequently block the user's access to the site with a warning.  While the approach ensures that th

WhatsApp Delays Controversial 'Data-Sharing' Privacy Policy Update By 3 Months<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/whatsapp-delays-controversial-data.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WhatsApp said on Friday that it wouldn't enforce its recently announced&nbsp; controversial data sharing policy &nbsp;update&nbsp;until May 15.  Originally set to go into effect next month on February 8, the three-month delay comes following "a lot of misinformation" about a revision to its privacy policy that allows WhatsApp to share data with Facebook, sparking widespread concerns about the exact kind of information that will be shared under the incoming terms.  The Facebook-owned company has since repeatedly clarified that the update does not expand its ability to share personal user chats or other profile information with Facebook and is instead simply providing further transparency about how user data is collected and shared when using the messaging app to interact with businesses.   "The update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data," WhatsApp&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post.  "W

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers took the wraps off a new spyware operation targeting users in Pakistan that leverages trojanized versions of legitimate Android apps to carry out covert surveillance and espionage.  Designed to masquerade apps such as the Pakistan Citizen Porta l, a Muslim prayer-clock app called Pakistan Salat Time , Mobile Packages Pakistan , Registered SIMs Checker , and TPL Insurance , the malicious variants have been found to obfuscate their operations to stealthily download a payload in the form of an Android Dalvik executable (DEX) file.  "The DEX payload contains most of the malicious features, which include the ability to covertly exfiltrate sensitive data like the user's contact list and the full contents of SMS messages," Sophos  threat researchers Pankaj Kohli and Andrew Brandt said.  "The app then sends this information to one of a small number of command-and-control websites hosted on servers located in eastern Europe."   Interestingly, t
