<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mozi, a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet known to target IoT devices, has gained new capabilities that allow it to achieve persistence on network gateways manufactured by Netgear, Huawei, and ZTE, according to new findings.  "Network gateways are a particularly juicy target for adversaries because they are ideal as initial access points to corporate networks," researchers at Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence Center and Section 52 at Azure Defender for IoT&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a technical write-up. "By infecting routers, they can perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks—via HTTP hijacking and DNS spoofing—to compromise endpoints and deploy ransomware or cause safety incidents in OT facilities."   First&nbsp; documented &nbsp;by Netlab 360 in December 2019, Mozi has a history of infecting routers and digital video recorders in order to assemble them into an IoT botnet, which could be abused for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, data exfiltration, and payload execution

Threat actors behind the infamous&nbsp; TrickBot &nbsp;malware have been linked to a new ransomware strain named "Diavol," according to the latest research.  Diavol and Conti ransomware payloads were deployed on different systems in a case of an unsuccessful attack targeting one of its customers earlier this month, researchers from Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs said last week.  TrickBot, a banking Trojan first detected in 2016, has been traditionally a Windows-based crimeware solution, employing different modules to perform a wide range of malicious activities on target networks, including credential theft and conduct ransomware attacks.&nbsp;   Despite efforts by law enforcement to neutralize the bot network, the ever-evolving malware has proven to be a&nbsp; resilient threat , what with the Russia-based operators — dubbed " Wizard Spider " — quickly adapting new tools to carry out further attacks.

Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday revealed details about a new Mirai-inspired botnet called "mirai_ptea" that leverages an undisclosed vulnerability in digital video recorders (DVR) provided by KGUARD to propagate and carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.  Chinese security firm Netlab 360&nbsp; pinned &nbsp;the first probe against the flaw on March 23, 2021, before it detected active exploitation attempts by the botnet on June 22, 2021.   The Mirai botnet, since&nbsp; emerging on the scene &nbsp;in 2016, has been linked to a string of large-scale DDoS attacks, including one against&nbsp; DNS service provider Dyn &nbsp;in October 2016, causing major internet platforms and services to remain inaccessible to users in Europe and North America.  Since then,&nbsp; numerous &nbsp; variants &nbsp;of&nbsp; Mirai &nbsp;have&nbsp; sprung up &nbsp;on&nbsp;the threat landscape, in part due to the availability of its source code on the Internet.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Monday disclosed a new wave of ongoing attacks exploiting multiple vulnerabilities to deploy Mirai variants on compromised systems.  "Upon successful exploitation, the attackers try to download a malicious shell script, which contains further infection behaviors such as downloading and executing Mirai variants and brute-forcers," Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 Threat Intelligence Team&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up.  The rash of vulnerabilities being exploited include:   VisualDoor &nbsp;— a SonicWall SSL-VPN remote command injection vulnerability that came to light earlier this January  CVE-2020-25506 &nbsp;- a D-Link DNS-320 firewall remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability  CVE-2021-27561 and CVE-2021-27562 &nbsp;- Two vulnerabilities in Yealink Device Management that allow an unauthenticated attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server with root privileges  CVE-2021-22502 &nbsp;- an RCE flaw in Micro Focus Operation Bridge Reporter (OBR), affecting version 10.40  CV

A new wormable botnet that spreads via GitHub and Pastebin to install cryptocurrency miners and backdoors on target systems has returned with expanded capabilities to compromise web applications, IP cameras, and routers.  Early last month, researchers from Juniper Threat Labs documented a crypto-mining campaign called " Gitpaste-12 ," which used GitHub to host malicious code containing as many as 12 known attack modules that are executed via commands downloaded from a Pastebin URL.
