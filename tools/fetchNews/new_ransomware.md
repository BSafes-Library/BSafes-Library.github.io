  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new ransomware strain called " DarkRadiation " that's implemented entirely in Bash and targets Linux and Docker cloud containers, while banking on messaging service Telegram for command-and-control (C2) communications.  "The ransomware is written in&nbsp; Bash &nbsp;script and targets Red Hat/CentOS and Debian Linux distributions," researchers from Trend Micro&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report published last week. "The malware uses OpenSSL's AES algorithm with CBC mode to encrypt files in various directories. It also uses Telegram's API to send an infection status to the threat actor(s)."   As of writing, there's no information available on the delivery methods or evidence that the ransomware has been deployed in real-world attacks.  The findings come from an analysis of a collection of hacking tools hosted on the unidentified threat actor's infrastructure (IP address "185.141.25.168") in a directory called

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed "distinctive" tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted by operators of Hades ransomware that set it apart from the rest of the pack, attributing it to a financially motivated threat group called&nbsp; GOLD WINTER .  "In many ways, the GOLD WINTER threat group is a typical post-intrusion ransomware threat group that pursues high-value targets to maximize how much money it can extort from its victims," researchers from SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) said in an analysis  shared with The Hacker News. "However, GOLD WINTER's operations have quirks that distinguish it from other groups."  The findings come from a study of incident response efforts the Atlanta-based cybersecurity firm engaged in the first quarter of 2021.   Since first emerging in the threat landscape in December 2020, Hades has been classified as INDRIK SPIDER's successor to&nbsp; WastedLocker &nbsp;ransomware with "additional code o

That's according to a new&nbsp; flash alert &nbsp;issued by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Thursday.  "The FBI identified at least 16 Conti ransomware attacks targeting U.S. healthcare and first responder networks, including law enforcement agencies, emergency medical services, 9-1-1 dispatch centers, and municipalities within the last year," the agency said.   Ransomware attacks have worsened over the years, with recent targets as varied as state and local governments, hospitals, police departments, and critical infrastructure.&nbsp; Conti &nbsp;is one of many ransomware strains that have capitulated on that trend, commencing its operations in July 2020 as a private Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), in addition to jumping on the double extort

DarkSide, the hacker group behind the&nbsp; Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack &nbsp;earlier this month, received $90 million in bitcoin payments following a nine-month ransomware spree, making it one of the most profitable cybercrime groups.  "In total, just over $90 million in bitcoin ransom payments were made to DarkSide, originating from 47 distinct wallets," blockchain analytics firm Elliptic&nbsp; said . "According to&nbsp; DarkTracer , 99 organisations have been infected with the DarkSide malware - suggesting that approximately 47% of victims paid a ransom, and that the average payment was $1.9 million."  Of the total $90 million haul, the DarkSide's developer is said to have received $15.5 million in bitcoins, while the remaining $74.7 million was split among its various affiliates. FireEye's research into DarkSide's affiliate program had&nbsp; previously revealed &nbsp;that its creators take a 25% cut for payments under $500,000 and 10% for ransoms above $5 million, with t

Just as Colonial Pipeline&nbsp; restored &nbsp;all of its systems to operational status in the wake of a crippling ransomware incident  a week ago, DarkSide, the cybercrime syndicate behind the attack, claimed it lost control of its infrastructure, citing a law enforcement seizure.  All the dark web sites operated by the gang, including its DarkSide Leaks blog, ransom collection site, and breach data content delivery network (CDN) servers, have gone dark and remain inaccessible as of writing. In addition, the funds from their cryptocurrency wallets were allegedly exfiltrated to an unknown account, according to a note passed by DarkSide operators to its affiliates.  "At the moment, these servers cannot be accessed via SSH, and the hosting panels have been blocked," the&nbsp; announcement &nbsp;obtained by Intel 471 read.   The development comes as DarkSide closed its Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) affiliate program for good "due to the pressure from the U.S.", with the group stating th

Dubbed "Project Signal," the initiative is said to have kickstarted sometime between late July 2020 and early September 2020, with ENP's internal research organization, named the "Studies Center," putting together a list of unspecified target websites.

An "aggressive" financially motivated threat group tapped into a zero-day flaw in SonicWall VPN appliances prior to it being patched by the company to deploy a new strain of ransomware called FIVEHANDS.  The group, tracked by cybersecurity firm Mandiant as UNC2447, took advantage of an "improper SQL command neutralization" flaw in the SSL-VPN SMA100 product ( CVE-2021-20016 , CVSS score 9 .8) that allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.  "UNC2447 monetizes intrusions by extorting their victims first with FIVEHANDS ransomware followed by aggressively applying pressure through threats of media attention and offering victim data for sale on hacker forums," Mandiant researchers&nbsp; said . "UNC2447 has been observed targeting organizations in Europe and North America and has consistently displayed advanced capabilities to evade detection and minimize post-intrusion forensics."

Prominent Apple supplier Quanta  on Wednesday said it suffered a ransomware attack from the REvil ransomware group, which is now demanding the iPhone maker pay a ransom of $50 million to prevent leaking sensitive files on the dark web.

More than a week after Microsoft released a&nbsp; one-click mitigation tool &nbsp;to mitigate cyberattacks targeting on-premises Exchange servers, the company&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;that patches have been applied to 92% of all internet-facing servers affected by the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities.  The development, a 43% improvement from the previous week, caps off a whirlwind of espionage and malware campaigns that hit thousands of companies worldwide, with as many as 10 advanced persistent threat (APT) groups opportunistically moving quickly to exploit the bugs.  According to telemetry data from RiskIQ, there are roughly 29,966 instances of Microsoft Exchange servers still exposed to attacks, down from 92,072 on March 10.   While Exchange servers were under assault by multiple Chinese-linked state-sponsored hacking groups prior to&nbsp; Microsoft's patch &nbsp;on March 2, the release of&nbsp; public proof-of-concept &nbsp;exploits fanned a feeding frenzy of infections, opening the door for escalating attacks like ransomwar

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Intel and Cybereason have partnered to build anti-ransomware defenses into the chipmaker's newly announced 11th generation Core&nbsp; vPro &nbsp;business-class processors.  The hardware-based security enhancements are baked into Intel's vPro platform via its&nbsp; Hardware Shield &nbsp;and&nbsp; Threat Detection Technology &nbsp;(TDT), enabling profiling and detection of ransomware and other threats that have an impact on the CPU performance.  "The joint solution represents the first instance where PC hardware plays a direct role in ransomware defenses to better protect enterprise endpoints from costly attacks," Cybereason&nbsp; said .   Exclusive to vPro, Intel Hardware Shield provides protections against firmware-level attacks targeting the&nbsp; BIOS , thereby ensuring that the operating system (OS) runs on legitimate hardware as well as minimizing the risk of malicious code injection by locking down memory in the BIOS when the software is running to help prevent planted malware from compromising the OS

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybercriminals are increasingly outsourcing the task of deploying ransomware to affiliates using commodity malware and attack tools, according to new research.  In a new analysis published by Sophos today and shared with The Hacker News, recent deployments of&nbsp; Ryuk &nbsp;and&nbsp; Egregor &nbsp;ransomware have involved the use of&nbsp; SystemBC &nbsp;backdoor to laterally move across the network and fetch additional payloads for further exploitation.  Affiliates are typically threat actors responsible for gaining an initial foothold in a target network.  "SystemBC is a regular part of recent ransomware attackers' toolkits," said Sophos senior threat researcher and former Ars Technica national security editor Sean Gallagher.   "The backdoor can be used in combination with other scripts and malware to perform discovery, exfiltration and lateral movement in an automated way across multiple targets. These SystemBC capabilities were originally intended for mass exploitation, but they have now be

Egregor Ransomware, Used in a String of High-Profile Attacks, Shows Connections to QakBot  <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/egregor-ransomware-attacks/">Full Text</a><br>
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .lh-1.0  }
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Egregor ransomware is a complex piece of malware that appears to be associated with the operators of QakBot. The ransomware has been used against organizations across many industries since its debut in September 2020 and is likely to continue to present a threat to organizations in the future. Unlike most ransomware variants, Egregor’s payload cannot be executed or decrypted fully without the correct cryptographic key provided to the malware at runtime, rendering static or dynamic analysis impossible. Because very little is known about the deployment of the ransomware in open sources and how the threat actors target victims, Recorded Future recommends employing mitigations for technical threats used by other “big game hunting” threat actors to mitigate the threat prior to ransom, using the provided hunting package to threat hunt Egregor and ensuring that internet-facing systems are appropriately configured to provide only the minimum needed access.
