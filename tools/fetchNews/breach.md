MobiKwik Suffers Major Breach — KYC Data of 3.5 Million Users Exposed<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/mobikwik-suffers-major-breach-kyc-data.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Popular Indian mobile payments service MobiKwik  on Monday came under fire after 8.2 terabytes (TB) of data belonging to millions of its users began circulating on the dark web in the aftermath of a major data breach that came to light earlier this month.  The leaked data includes sensitive personal information such as: customer names, hashed passwords, email addresses, residential addresses, GPS locations, list of installed apps, partially-masked credit card numbers, connected bank accounts and associated account numbers, and know your customer (KYC) documents of 3.5 million users.  Even worse, the leak also shows that MobiKwik does not&nbsp; delete the card information &nbsp;from its servers even after a user has removed them, in what's likely a breach of government regulations.  New guidelines issued by India's apex banking institution, the Reserve Bank of India,&nbsp; prohibit &nbsp;online merchants, e-commerce websites, and payment aggregators from storing card details of a customer online.

The changes are said to have been made yesterday on March 28.

In a second update issued on Monday, the agency said it had secured its email infrastructure and that it found no evidence of data extraction, adding it has "no indication to think that the breach has gone beyond our email servers."

Enterprise cloud security firm Qualys  has become the latest victim to join a long list of entities to have suffered a data breach after zero-day vulnerabilities in its Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) server were exploited to steal sensitive business documents.

Confirming the incident, Qualys Chief Information Security Officer Ben Carr&nbsp; said &nbsp;a detailed probe "identified unauthorized access to files hosted on the Accellion FTA server" located in a DMZ (aka&nbsp; demilitarized zone ) environment that's segregated from the rest of the internal network.

The massive state-sponsored&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;that compromised software maker SolarWinds also targeted Microsoft, as the unfolding investigation into the hacking spree reveals the incident may have been far more wider in scope, sophistication, and impact than previously thought.  News of Microsoft's compromise was first reported by Reuters , which also said the company's own products were then used to strike other victims by leveraging its cloud offerings, citing people familiar with the matter.  The Windows maker, however, denied the threat actor had infiltrated its production systems to stage further attacks against its customers.  In a statement to The Hacker News via email, the company said —  "Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious SolarWinds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed a new supply-chain attack targeting the Vietnam Government Certification Authority (VGCA) that compromised the agency's digital signature toolkit to install a backdoor on victim systems.  Uncovered by Slovak internet security company ESET  early this month, the "SignSight" attack involved modifying software installers hosted on the CA's&nbsp; website &nbsp;("ca.gov.vn") to insert a spyware tool called&nbsp; PhantomNet &nbsp;or Smanager.  According to ESET's telemetry, the breach happened from at least July 23 to August 16, 2020, with the&nbsp; two installers &nbsp;in question — "gca01-client-v2-x32-8.3.msi" and "gca01-client-v2-x64-8.3.msi" for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems — tampered to include the backdoor.   After the attack was reported to VGCA, the certificate authority confirmed that "they were aware of the attack before our notification and that they notified the users who downloaded the trojanized softwar

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The investigation into how the attackers managed to compromise SolarWinds' internal network and poison the company's software updates are still underway, but we may one step close to understanding what appears to be a very meticulously planned and highly-sophisticated supply chain attack.  A new report  published by ReversingLabs today and shared in advance with The Hacker News has revealed that the operators behind the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;likely managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the malicious backdoor through its software release process.  "The source code of the affected library was directly modified to include malicious backdoor code, which was compiled, signed, and delivered through the existing software patch release management system," ReversingLabs' Tomislav Pericin said.   Cybersecurity firm FireEye earlier this week&nbsp; detailed &nbsp;how multiple SolarWinds

SolarWinds, the enterprise monitoring software provider who found itself at the epicenter of the most&nbsp; consequential supply chain attacks , said as many as 18,000 of its high-profile customers might have installed a tainted version of its Orion products.  The acknowledgment comes as part of a new filing made by the company to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.  The Texas-based company serves more than 300,000 customers worldwide, including every branch of the US military and four-fifths of the Fortune 500 companies.  The "incident was likely the result of a highly sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by an outside nation state," SolarWinds said in the&nbsp; regulatory disclosure , adding it "currently believes the actual number of customers that may have had an installation of the Orion products that contained this vulnerability to be fewer than 18,000."
