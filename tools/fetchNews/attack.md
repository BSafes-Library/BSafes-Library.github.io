<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is warning of active exploitation attempts that leverage the latest line of " ProxyShell " Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities that were patched earlier this May, including deploying LockFile ransomware on compromised systems.  Tracked as CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207, the vulnerabilities enable adversaries to bypass ACL controls, elevate privileges on the Exchange PowerShell backend, effectively permitting the attacker to perform unauthenticated, remote code execution. While the former two were addressed by Microsoft on April 13, a patch for CVE-2021-31207 was shipped as part of the Windows maker's May Patch Tuesday updates.   "An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable machine," CISA&nbsp; said .  The development comes a little over a week after cybersecurity researchers sounded the alarm on&nbsp; opportunistic scanning and exploitation &nbsp;of unpat

A novel technique leverages optical emanations from a device's power indicator LED to recover sounds from connected peripherals and spy on electronic conversations from a distance of as much as 35 meters.  Dubbed the " Glowworm attack ," the findings were published by a group of academics from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev earlier this week, describing the method as "an optical&nbsp; TEMPEST &nbsp;attack that can be used by eavesdroppers to recover sound by analysing optical measurements obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of various devices."  Accompanying the experimental setup is an optical-audio transformation (OAT) that allows for retrieving sound by isolating the speech from the optical measurements obtained by directing an electro-optical sensor at the device's power indicator LED.   TEMPEST is the codename for unintentional intelligence-bearing emanations produced by electronic and electromechanical information-

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The U.S. is presently combating two pandemics--coronavirus and ransomware attacks. Both have partially shut down parts of the economy. However, in the case of cybersecurity, lax security measures allow hackers to have an easy way to rake in millions.  It's pretty simple for hackers to gain financially, using malicious software to access and encrypt data and hold it hostage until the victim pays the ransom.  Cyber attacks are more frequent now because it is effortless for hackers to execute them. Further, the payment methods are now friendlier to them. In addition, businesses are&nbsp; willing to pay a ransom &nbsp;because of the growing reliance on digital infrastructure, giving hackers more incentives to attempt more breaches.&nbsp;  Bolder cybercriminals  A few years back, cybercriminals played psychological games before getting bank passwords and using their technical know-how to steal money from people's accounts. They are bolder now because it is easy for them to buy ransomware software

IT Giant Accenture Hit by LockBit Ransomware; Hackers Threaten to Leak Data<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/it-giant-accenture-hit-by-lockbit.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Global IT consultancy giant Accenture has become the latest company to be hit by the LockBit ransomware gang, according to a post made by the operators on their dark web portal, likely filling a void left in the wake of DarkSide and REvil shutdown.  "These people are beyond privacy and security. I really hope that their services are better than what I saw as an insider," read a message posted on the data leak website. Accenture&nbsp; said &nbsp;it has since restored the affected systems from backups.   LockBit, like its now-defunct DarkSide and REvil counterparts, operates using a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, roping in other cybercriminals (aka affiliates) to carry out the intrusion using its platform, with the payments often divided between the criminal entity directing the attack and the core developers of the malware.   The ransomware group emerged on the threat landscape in September 2019, and in June 2021 launched LockBit 2.0 along with an advertising campaign to recruit

New PetitPotam NTLM Relay Attack Lets Hackers Take Over Windows Domains<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/new-petitpotam-ntlm-relay-attack-lets.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly uncovered security flaw in the Windows operating system can be exploited to coerce remote Windows servers, including Domain Controllers, to authenticate with a malicious destination, thereby allowing an adversary to stage an&nbsp; NTLM relay attack &nbsp;and completely take over a Windows domain.  The issue, dubbed " PetitPotam ," was discovered by security researcher Gilles Lionel, who shared technical details and proof-of-concept (PoC) code last week, noting that the flaw works by forcing "Windows hosts to authenticate to other machines via MS-EFSRPC EfsRpcOpenFileRaw function."  MS-EFSRPC &nbsp;is Microsoft's Encrypting File System Remote Protocol that's used to perform "maintenance and management operations on encrypted data that is stored remotely and accessed over a network."   Specifically, the attack enables a domain controller to authenticate against a remote NTLM under a bad actor's control using the MS-EFSRPC interface and share its authen

Microsoft on Tuesday disclosed that the latest string of attacks targeting SolarWinds Serv-U managed file transfer service with a now-patched remote code execution (RCE) exploit is the handiwork of a Chinese threat actor dubbed "DEV-0322."  The revelation comes days after the Texas-based IT monitoring software maker issued fixes for the flaw that could enable adversaries to remotely run arbitrary code with privileges, allowing them to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads or view and alter sensitive data.  Tracked as&nbsp; CVE-2021-35211 , the RCE flaw resides in Serv-U's implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. While it was previously revealed that the attacks were limited in scope, SolarWinds said it's "unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Thursday took the wraps off a new, ongoing espionage campaign targeting corporate networks in Spanish-speaking countries, specifically Venezuela, to spy on its victims.  Dubbed " Bandidos " by ESET owing to the use of an upgraded variant of Bandook malware, the primary targets of the threat actor are corporate networks in the South American country spanning across manufacturing, construction, healthcare, software services, and retail sectors.  Written in both Delphi and C++,&nbsp; Bandook &nbsp;has a history of being sold as a commercial remote access trojan (RAT) dating all the way back to 2005. Since then, numerous variants have emerged on the threat landscape and put to use in different surveillance campaigns in 2015 and 2017, allegedly by a cyber-mercenary group known as Dark Caracal on behalf of government interests in Kazakhstan and Lebanon.   In a continuing resurgence of the Bandook Trojan, Check Point last year&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;three new samples — one

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. technology firm Kaseya, which is firefighting the largest ever&nbsp; supply-chain ransomware strike &nbsp;on its VSA on-premises product, ruled out the possibility that its codebase was unauthorizedly tampered with to distribute malware.  While initial reports raised speculations that the ransomware gang might have gained access to Kaseya's backend infrastructure and abused it to deploy a malicious update to VSA servers running on client premises, in a modus operandi similar to that of the devastating SolarWinds hack, it has since emerged that a never-before-seen security vulnerability ( CVE-2021-30116 ) in the software was leveraged to push ransomware to Kaseya's customers.   "The attackers were able to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the VSA product to bypass authentication and run arbitrary command execution," the Miami-headquartered company&nbsp; noted &nbsp;in the incident analysis. "This allowed the attackers to leverage the standard VSA product functionality to depl

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Taiwanese networking equipment company Zyxel is warning customers of an ongoing attack targeting a "small subset" of its security products such as firewall and VPN servers.  Attributing the attacks to a "sophisticated threat actor," the firm noted that the attacks single out appliances that have remote management or SSL VPN enabled, namely in the USG/ZyWALL, USG FLEX, ATP, and VPN series running on-premise ZLD firmware, implying that the targeted devices are publicly accessible over the internet.   "The threat actor attempts to access a device through WAN; if successful, they then bypass authentication and establish SSL VPN tunnels with unknown user accounts, such as 'zyxel_slIvpn', 'zyxel_ts', or 'zyxel_vpn_test', to manipulate the device's configuration," Zyxel said in an&nbsp; email message , which was shared on Twitter.   As of writing, it's not immediately known if the attacks are exploiting previously known vulnerabilities

Malware Attack on South Korean Entities Was Work of Andariel Group<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/malware-attack-on-south-korean-entities.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A malware campaign targeting South Korean entities that came to light earlier this year has been attributed to a North Korean nation-state hacking group called Andariel, once again indicating that&nbsp; Lazarus &nbsp;attackers are following the trends and their&nbsp; arsenal &nbsp;is in&nbsp; constant development .  "The way Windows commands and their options were used in this campaign is almost identical to previous Andariel activity," Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a deep-dive published Tuesday. Victims of the attack are in the manufacturing, home network service, media, and construction sectors.   Designated as part of the Lazarus constellation, Andariel is known for unleashing attacks on South Korean organizations and businesses using specifically tailored methods created for maximum effectivity. In September 2019, the sub-group, along with Lazarus and Bluenoroff, was&nbsp; sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department &nbsp;for their malicious cyber activity on critical infrastructure.  Anda

NoxPlayer Supply-Chain Attack is Likely the Work of Gelsemium Hackers<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/noxplayer-supply-chain-attack-is-likely.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A new cyber espionage group named Gelsemium has been linked to a&nbsp; supply chain attack targeting the NoxPlayer &nbsp;Android emulator that was disclosed earlier this year.  The findings come from a systematic analysis of multiple campaigns undertaken by the APT crew, with evidence of the earliest attack dating back all the way to 2014 under the codename&nbsp; Operation TooHash &nbsp;based on malware payloads deployed in those intrusions.  "Victims of these campaigns are located in East Asia as well as the Middle East and include governments, religious organizations, electronics manufacturers and universities," cybersecurity firm ESET&nbsp; said &nbsp;in an analysis published last week.   "Gelsemium's whole chain might appear simple at first sight, but the exhaustive configurations, implanted at each stage, modify on-the-fly settings for the final payload, making it harder to understand."  Targeted countries include China, Mongolia, North and South Korea, Japan, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Saudi

New TLS Attack Lets Attackers Launch Cross-Protocol Attacks Against Secure Sites<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/new-tls-attack-lets-attackers-launch.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have disclosed a new type of attack that exploits misconfigurations in transport layer security (TLS) servers to redirect HTTPS traffic from a victim's web browser to a different TLS service endpoint located on another IP address to steal sensitive information.  The attacks have been dubbed&nbsp; ALPACA , short for "Application Layer Protocol Confusion - Analyzing and mitigating Cracks in tls Authentication," by a group of academics from Ruhr University Bochum, Münster University of Applied Sciences, and Paderborn University.  "Attackers can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session," the study said. "This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise the other at the application layer."  TLS &nbsp;is a cryptographic protocol underpinning several application layer protocols like HTTPS, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP to secure com

Crypto-Mining Attacks Targeting Kubernetes Clusters via Kubeflow Instances<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/crypto-mining-attacks-targeting.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday disclosed a new large-scale campaign targeting Kubeflow deployments to run malicious cryptocurrency mining containers.  The campaign involved deploying&nbsp; TensorFlow &nbsp;pods on Kubernetes clusters, with the pods running legitimate&nbsp; TensorFlow images &nbsp;from the official Docker Hub account. However, the container images were configured to execute rogue commands that mine cryptocurrencies. Microsoft said the deployments witnessed an uptick towards the end of May.   Kubeflow &nbsp;is an open-source machine learning platform designed to deploy machine learning workflows on&nbsp; Kubernetes , an orchestration service used for managing and scaling containerized workloads across a cluster of machines.  The deployment, in itself, was achieved by taking advantage of Kubeflow, which exposes its UI functionality via a dashboard that is deployed in the cluster. In the attack observed by Microsoft, the adversaries used the centralized dashboard as an ingress point to create a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
State-sponsored hackers affiliated with North Korea have been behind a slew of attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges  over the past three years, new evidence has revealed.  Attributing the attack with "medium-high" likelihood to the Lazarus Group (aka APT38 or Hidden Cobra), researchers from Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky said the campaign, dubbed " CryptoCore ," targeted crypto exchanges in Israel, Japan, Europe, and the U.S., resulting in the theft of millions of dollars worth of virtual currencies.   The&nbsp; findings &nbsp;are a consequence of piecing together artifacts from a series of isolated but similar reports detailed by&nbsp; F-Secure , Japanese CERT&nbsp; JPCERT/CC , and&nbsp; NTT Security &nbsp;over the past few months.  Since emerging on the scene in 2009,&nbsp; Hidden Cobra &nbsp;actors have used their offensive cyber capabilities to carry out espionage and cyber cryptocurrency heists against businesses and critical infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
U.S. insurance giant CNA Financial reportedly paid $40 million to a ransomware gang to recover access to its systems following an attack in March, making it one the most expensive ransoms paid to date.  The development was first&nbsp; reported &nbsp;by Bloomberg, citing "people with knowledge of the attack." The adversary that staged the intrusion is said to have allegedly demanded $60 million a week after the Chicago-based company began negotiations with the hackers, culminating in the payment two weeks following the theft of company data.  In a statement shared on May 12, CNA Financial&nbsp; said &nbsp;it had "no evidence to indicate that external customers were potentially at risk of infection due to the incident."   The attack has been attributed to new ransomware known as 'Phoenix CryptoLocker,' according to a&nbsp; March report &nbsp;from Bleeping Computer, with the strain believed to be an offshoot of&nbsp; WastedLocker &nbsp;and Hades, both of which have been utilized by&nbsp; Evil Corp , a Ru

An investigation undertaken in the aftermath of the&nbsp; Oldsmar water plant hack &nbsp;earlier this year has revealed that an infrastructure contractor in the U.S. state of Florida hosted malicious code on its website in what's known as a watering hole attack.  "This malicious code seemingly targeted water utilities, particularly in Florida, and more importantly, was visited by a browser from the city of Oldsmar on the same day of the poisoning event," Dragos researcher Kent Backman&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published on Tuesday.  The site, which belongs to a Florida-based general contractor involved in building water and wastewater treatment facilities, had no bearing on the intrusion, the American industrial cybersecurity firm said.   Watering hole attacks typically allow an adversary to compromise a specific group of end-users by compromising a carefully selected website, which members of that group are known to visit, with an intention to gain access to the victim's system an

70 European and South American Banks Under Attack By Bizarro Banking Malware<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/70-european-and-south-american-banks.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially motivated cybercrime gang has unleashed a previously undocumented banking trojan, which can steal credentials from customers of 70 banks located in various European and South American countries.  Dubbed " Bizarro " by Kaspersky researchers, the Windows malware is "using affiliates or recruiting money mules to operationalize their attacks, cashing out or simply to helping [sic] with transfers."  The campaign consists of multiple moving parts, chief among them being the ability to trick users into entering two-factor authentication codes in fake pop-up windows that are then sent to the attackers, as well as its reliance on social engineering lures to convince visitors of banking websites into downloading a malicious smartphone app.   Bizarro, which uses compromised WordPress, Amazon, and Azure servers to host the malware, is distributed via MSI packages downloaded by victims from sketchy links in spam emails. Launching the package downloads a ZIP archiv

New Browser Attack Allows Tracking Users Online With JavaScript Disabled<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/new-browser-attack-allows-tracking.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have discovered a new side-channel that they say can be reliably exploited to leak information from web browsers that could then be leveraged to track users even when JavaScript is completely disabled.  "This is a side-channel attack which doesn't require any JavaScript to run," the researchers said. "This means script blockers cannot stop it. The attacks work even if you strip out all of the fun parts of the web browsing experience. This makes it very difficult to prevent without modifying deep parts of the operating system."  In avoiding JavaScript, the side-channel attacks are also architecturally agnostic, resulting in microarchitectural website fingerprinting attacks that work across hardware platforms, including Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, Samsung Exynos 2100, and Apple M1 CPUs — making it the first known side-channel attack on the iPhone maker's new ARM-based chipsets.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Microsoft on Friday warned of active attacks exploiting unpatched Exchange Servers carried out by multiple threat actors, as the hacking campaign is believed to have infected tens of thousands of businesses, government entities in the U.S., Asia, and Europe.  The company&nbsp; said &nbsp;"it continues to see increased use of these vulnerabilities in attacks targeting unpatched systems by multiple malicious actors beyond HAFNIUM," signaling an escalation that the breaches are no longer "limited and targeted" as was previously deemed.  According to independent cybersecurity journalist&nbsp; Brian Krebs , at least 30,000 entities across the U.S. — mainly small businesses, towns, cities, and local governments — have been compromised by an "unusually aggressive" Chinese group that has set its sights on stealing emails from victim organizations by exploiting previously undisclosed flaws in Exchange Server.

In what's a case of hackers getting hacked, a prominent underground online criminal forum by the name of Maza has been compromised by unknown attackers, making it the fourth forum to have been breached since the start of the year.  The intrusion is said to have occurred on March 3, with information about the forum members — including usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords — publicly disclosed on a breach notification page put up by the attackers, stating "Your data has been leaked" and "This forum has been hacked."  "The announcement was accompanied by a PDF file allegedly containing a portion of forum user data. The file comprised more than 3,000 rows, containing usernames, partially obfuscated password hashes, email addresses and other contact details," cybersecurity firm Intel 471&nbsp; said .

SolarWinds Blames Intern for Weak Password That Led to Biggest Attack in 2020<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/solarwinds-blame-intern-for-weak.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As cybersecurity researchers continue to piece together the sprawling&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack , top executives of the Texas-based software services firm blamed an intern for a critical password lapse that went unnoticed for several years.&nbsp;  The said password " solarwinds123 " was originally believed to have been publicly accessible via a GitHub repository since June 17, 2018, before the misconfiguration was addressed on November 22, 2019.  But in a&nbsp; hearing &nbsp;before the House Committees on Oversight and Reform and Homeland Security on SolarWinds on Friday, CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna testified that the password had been in use as early as 2017.  While a preliminary investigation into the attack revealed that the operators behind the espionage campaign managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the Sunburst backdoor, Crowdstrike's incident response efforts pointed to a&nbsp; revi

Experts Warns of Notable Increase in QuickBooks Data Files Theft Attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/experts-warns-of-notable-increase-in.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
New research has uncovered a significant increase in QuickBooks file data theft using social engineering tricks to deliver malware and exploit the accounting software.  "A majority of the time, the attack involves basic malware that is often signed, making it hard to detect using antivirus or other threat detection software," researchers from ThreatLocker said in an analysis shared today with The Hacker News.  QuickBooks is an accounting software package developed and marketed by Intuit.   The spear-phishing attacks take the form of a PowerShell command that's capable of running inside of the email, the researchers said, adding, a second attack vector involves decoy documents sent via email messages that, when opened, runs a macro to download malicious code which uploads QuickBooks files to an attacker-controlled server.  Alternatively, bad actors have also been spotted running a PowerShell command called&nbsp; Invoke-WebRequests &nbsp;on target systems to upload relevant data to

Shadow Attacks Let Attackers Replace Content in Digitally Signed PDFs<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/shadow-attacks-let-attackers-replace.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Researchers have demonstrated a novel class of attacks that could allow a bad actor to potentially circumvent existing countermeasures and break the integrity protection of digitally signed PDF documents.  Called " Shadow attacks " by academics from Ruhr-University Bochum, the technique uses the "enormous flexibility provided by the PDF specification so that shadow documents remain standard-compliant."  The findings were presented yesterday at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), with 16 of the 29 PDF viewers tested — including Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, Perfect PDF, and Okular — found vulnerable to shadow attacks.  To carry out the attack, a malicious actor creates a PDF document with two different contents: one which is the content that's expected by the party signing the document, and the other, a piece of hidden content that gets displayed once the PDF is signed.  "The signers of the PDF receive the document, review it, and s

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a&nbsp;novel attack&nbsp;that could allow criminals to trick a point of sale terminal into transacting with a victim's Mastercard contactless card while believing it to be a Visa card.  The research, published by a group of academics from the ETH Zurich, builds on a study&nbsp; detailed last September &nbsp;that delved into a PIN bypass attack, permitting bad actors to leverage a victim's stolen or lost Visa EMV-enabled credit card for making high-value purchases without knowledge of the card's PIN, and even fool the terminal into accepting unauthentic offline card transactions.  "This is not just a mere card brand mixup but it has critical consequences," researchers David Basin, Ralf Sasse, and Jorge Toro said. "For example, criminals can use it in combination with the previous attack on Visa to also bypass the PIN for Mastercard cards. The cards of this brand were previously presumed protected by PIN."

The breach, which occurred last Friday, involved an&nbsp; unsuccessful attempt &nbsp;on the part of an adversary to increase sodium hydroxide dosage in the water supply to dangerous levels by remotely accessing the SCADA system at the water treatment plant. The system's plant operator, who spotted the intrusion, quickly took steps to reverse the command, leading to minimal impact.   Now, according to an&nbsp; advisory &nbsp;published on Wednesday by the state of Massachusetts, unidentified cyber actors accessed the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system via TeamViewer software installed on one of the plant's several computers that were connected to the control system.  Not only were these computers running 32-bit versions of the Windows 7 operating system, but

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In what's a novel supply chain attack, a security researcher managed to breach over 35 major companies' internal systems, including that of Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, Shopify, Netflix, Yelp, Tesla, and Uber, and achieve remote code execution.  The technique, called dependency confusion  or a substitution attack, takes advantage of the fact that a piece of software may include components from a mix of private and public sources.  These external package dependencies, which are fetched from public repositories during a build process, can pose an attack opportunity when an adversary uploads a higher version of a private module to the public feed, causing a client to automatically download the bogus "latest" version without requiring any action from the developer.   "From one-off mistakes made by developers on their own machines, to misconfigured internal or cloud-based build servers, to systemically vulnerable development pipelines, one thing was clear: squatting val

New Attack Could Let Remote Hackers Target Devices On Internal Networks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/new-attack-could-let-remote-hackers.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly devised variant of the&nbsp; NAT Slipstreaming attack &nbsp;can be leveraged to compromise and expose any device in an internal network, according to the latest research.  Detailed by enterprise IoT security firm Armis, the&nbsp; new attack &nbsp;(CVE-2020-16043 and CVE-2021-23961) builds on the previously disclosed technique to bypass routers and firewalls and reach any unmanaged device within the internal network from the Internet.  First&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;by security researcher Samy Kamkar in late October 2020, the JavaScript-based attack relied on luring a user into visiting a malicious website to circumvent browser-based port restrictions and allow the attacker to remotely access TCP/UDP services on the victim's device, even those that were protected by a firewall or NAT.   Although partial mitigations were released on November 11 to thwart the attack in&nbsp; Chrome 87 ,&nbsp; Firefox 84 , and&nbsp; Safari &nbsp;by preventing connections on port 5060 or 5061, Armis researchers Ben Seri and Gregory Vishnipolsky r

New Attack Could Let Hackers Clone Your Google Titan 2FA Security Keys<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/new-attack-could-let-hackers-clone-your.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Hardware security keys—such as those from Google and Yubico—are considered the most secure means to protect accounts from phishing and takeover attacks.  But a new research published on Thursday demonstrates how an adversary in possession of such a two-factor authentication (2FA) device can clone it by exploiting an electromagnetic side-channel in the chip embedded in it.  The vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2021-3011 ) allows the bad actor to extract the encryption key or the&nbsp; ECDSA &nbsp;private key linked to a victim's account from a FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) device like Google Titan Key or YubiKey, thus completely undermining the 2FA protections.  "The adversary can sign in to the victim's application account without the U2F device, and without the victim noticing," NinjaLab researchers Victor Lomne and Thomas Roche&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a 60-page analysis.   "In other words the adversary created a clone of the U2F device for the victim's application account. This cl
