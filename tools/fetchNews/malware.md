A framework notorious for delivering a banking Trojan has received a facelift to deploy a wider range of malware, including ransomware payloads.  "The&nbsp; Gootkit &nbsp;malware family has been around more than half a decade – a mature Trojan with functionality centered around banking credential theft," Sophos researchers Gabor Szappanos and Andrew Brandt&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a write-up published today.  "In recent years, almost as much effort has gone into improvement of its delivery method as has gone into the NodeJS-based malware itself."  Dubbed "Gootloader," the expanded malware delivery system comes amid a surge in the number of infections targeting users in France, Germany, South Korea, and the U.S.   First documented in 2014, Gootkit is a Javascript-based malware platform capable of carrying out an array of covert activities, including web injection, capturing keystrokes, taking screenshots, recording videos, as well as email and password theft.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A credential stealer infamous for targeting Windows systems has resurfaced in a new phishing campaign that aims to steal credentials from Microsoft Outlook, Google Chrome, and instant messenger apps.  Primarily directed against users in Turkey, Latvia, and Italy starting mid-January, the attacks involve the use of&nbsp; MassLogger &nbsp;— a .NET-based malware with capabilities to hinder static analysis — building on similar campaigns undertaken by the same actor against users in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Hungary, Estonia, Romania, and Spain in September, October, and November 2020.  MassLogger was first spotted in the wild last April, but the presence of a new variant implies malware authors are constantly retooling their arsenal to evade detection and monetize them.   "Although operations of the Masslogger trojan have been previously documented, we found the new campaign notable for using the compiled HTML file format to start the infection chain," researchers with Cisco Talos&nbsp; said &nbsp;on W

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the first malware samples tailored to run natively on Apple's M1 chips has been discovered, suggesting a new development that indicates that bad actors have begun adapting malicious software to target the company's latest generation of Macs powered by its own processors.  While the transition to Apple silicon has necessitated developers to build new versions of their apps to ensure better performance and compatibility, malware authors are now undertaking similar steps to build malware that are capable of executing natively on Apple's new M1 systems, according to macOS Security researcher Patrick Wardle.  Wardle detailed a Safari adware extension called GoSearch22 that was originally written to run on Intel x86 chips but has since been ported to run on ARM-based M1 chips. The rogue extension, which is a variant of the Pirrit advertising malware, was first seen in the wild on November 23, 2020, according to a sample&nbsp; uploaded &nbsp;to VirusTotal on December 27.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A previously known Windows remote access Trojan (RAT) with credential-stealing capabilities has now expanded its scope to set its sights on users of Android devices to further the attacker's espionage motives.  "The developers of&nbsp; LodaRAT &nbsp;have added Android as a targeted platform," Cisco Talos researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "A new iteration of LodaRAT for Windows has been identified with improved sound recording capabilities."  Kasablanca, the group behind the malware, is said to have deployed the new RAT in an ongoing hybrid campaign targeting Bangladeshi users, the researchers noted.  The reason why Bangladesh-based organizations have been specifically singled out for this campaign remains unclear, as is the identity of the threat actor.   First documented in May 2017 by&nbsp; Proofpoint , Loda is an AutoIt malware typically delivered via phishing lures that's equipped to run a wide range of commands designed to record audio, video, and capture oth

Google on Thursday removed The Great Suspender , a popular Chrome extension used by millions of users, from its Chrome Web Store for containing malware. It also took the unusual step of deactivating it from users' computers.  "This extension contains malware,"&nbsp; read &nbsp;a terse notification from Google, but it has since emerged that the add-on stealthily added features that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code from a remote server, including tracking users online and committing advertising fraud.  "The old maintainer appears to have sold the extension to parties unknown, who have malicious intent to exploit the users of this extension in advertising fraud, tracking, and more," Calum McConnell&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a GitHub post.   The extension, which had more than two million installs before it was disabled, would suspend tabs that aren't in use, replacing them with a blank gray screen until they were reloaded upon returning to the tabs in question.

High-performance computing clusters belonging to university networks as well as servers associated with government agencies, endpoint security vendors, and internet service providers have been targeted by a newly discovered backdoor that gives attackers the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the systems remotely.  Cybersecurity firm ESET named the malware " Kobalos " — a nod to a " mischievous creature " of the same name from Greek mythology — for its "tiny code size and many tricks."  "Kobalos is a generic backdoor in the sense that it contains broad commands that don't reveal the intent of the attackers," researchers Marc-Etienne M. Léveillé and Ignacio Sanmillan&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Tuesday analysis. "In short, Kobalos grants remote access to the file system, provides the ability to spawn terminal sessions, and allows proxying connections to other Kobalos-infected servers."

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security researchers on Tuesday uncovered new delivery and evasion techniques adopted by Agent Tesla remote access trojan (RAT) to get around defense barriers and monitor its victims.  Typically spread through&nbsp;social engineering&nbsp;lures, the Windows spyware not only now targets Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface ( AMSI ) in an attempt to defeat endpoint protection software, it also employs a multi-stage installation process and makes use of Tor and Telegram messaging API to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server.  Cybersecurity firm Sophos , which observed two versions of Agent Tesla — version 2 and version 3 — currently in the wild, said the changes are yet another sign of Agent Tesla's constant evolution designed to make a sandbox and static analysis more difficult.   "The differences we see between v2 and v3 of Agent Tesla appear to be focused on improving the success rate of the malware against sandbox defenses and malware scanners, and on providing more

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers today disclosed a new supply chain attack compromising the update mechanism of NoxPlayer, a free Android emulator for PCs and Macs.  Dubbed " Operation NightScout " by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, the highly-targeted surveillance campaign involved distributing three different malware families via tailored malicious updates to selected victims based in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.  NoxPlayer, developed by Hong Kong-based BigNox, is an Android emulator that allows users to play mobile games on PC, with support for keyboard, gamepad, script recording, and multiple instances. It is&nbsp; estimated &nbsp;to have over 150 million users in more than 150 countries.   First signs of the ongoing attack are said to have originated around September 2020, from when the compromise continued until "explicitly malicious activity" was uncovered this week, prompting ESET to report the incident to BigNox.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A financially-motivated threat actor notorious for its cryptojacking attacks has leveraged a revised version of their malware to target cloud infrastructures using vulnerabilities in web server technologies, according to new research.  Deployed by the China-based cybercrime group&nbsp; Rocke , the Pro-Ocean cryptojacking malware now comes with improved rootkit and worm capabilities, as well as harbors new evasion tactics to sidestep cybersecurity companies' detection methods, Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 researchers&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Thursday write-up.   "Pro-Ocean uses known vulnerabilities to target cloud applications," the researchers detailed. "In our analysis, we found Pro-Ocean targeting Apache ActiveMQ ( CVE-2016-3088 ), Oracle WebLogic ( CVE-2017-10271 ) and Redis (unsecure instances)."  "Once installed, the malware kills any process that uses the CPU heavily, so that it's able to use 100% of the CPU and mine Monero efficiently."  First documented

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A newly discovered Android malware has been found to propagate itself through WhatsApp messages to other contacts in order to expand what appears to be an adware campaign.  "This malware spreads via victim's WhatsApp by automatically replying to any received WhatsApp message notification with a link to [a] malicious Huawei Mobile app," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko  said.  The link to the fake Huawei Mobile app, upon clicking, redirects users to a lookalike Google Play Store website.  Once installed, the wormable app prompts victims to grant it notification access, which is then abused to carry out the wormable attack.   Specifically, it leverages WhatApp's quick reply feature — which is used to respond to incoming messages directly from the notifications — to send out a reply to a received message automatically.  Besides requesting permissions to read notifications, the app also requests intrusive access to run in the background as well as to draw over other apps,

MrbMiner Crypto-Mining Malware Links to Iranian Software Company<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/mrbminer-crypto-mining-malware-links-to.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A relatively new crypto-mining malware that surfaced last year and infected thousands of Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) databases has now been linked to a small software development company based in Iran.  The attribution was made possible due to an operational security oversight, said researchers from cybersecurity firm Sophos, that led to the company's name inadvertently making its way into the cryptominer code.  First documented by Chinese tech giant Tencent last September,&nbsp; MrbMiner &nbsp;was found to target internet-facing MSSQL servers with the goal of installing a cryptominer, which hijacks the processing power of the systems to mine Monero and funnel them into accounts controlled by the attackers.  The name "MrbMiner" comes after one of the domains used by the group to host their malicious mining software.   "In many ways, MrbMiner's operations appear typical of most cryptominer attacks we've seen targeting internet-facing servers,"&nbsp; said &nbsp;Gabor Szappa

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have unearthed a fourth new malware strain—designed to spread the malware onto other computers in victims' networks—which was deployed as part of the&nbsp; SolarWinds supply chain attack &nbsp;disclosed late last year.  Dubbed "Raindrop" by Broadcom-owned Symantec, the malware joins the likes of other malicious implants such as&nbsp; Sunspot , Sunburst (or Solorigate), and Teardrop that were stealthily delivered to enterprise networks.   The latest finding comes amid a continued probe into the breach, suspected to be of&nbsp; Russian origin , that has claimed a number of U.S. government agencies and private sector companies.  "The discovery of Raindrop is a significant step in our investigation of the SolarWinds attacks as it provides further insights into post-compromise activity at organizations of interest to the attackers," Symantec researchers&nbsp; said .  The cybersecurity firm said it discovered only four samples of Raindrop to date that were used to d

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing malware campaign has been found exploiting recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Linux devices to co-opt the systems into an&nbsp; IRC botnet &nbsp;for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and mining Monero cryptocurrency.  The attacks involve a new malware variant called " FreakOut " that leverages newly patched flaws in TerraMaster, Laminas Project (formerly Zend Framework), and Liferay Portal, according to Check Point Research's new analysis published  today and shared with The Hacker News.   Attributing the malware to be the work of a long-time cybercrime hacker — who goes by the aliases Fl0urite and Freak on HackForums and Pastebin as early as 2015 — the researchers said the flaws —&nbsp; CVE-2020-28188 ,&nbsp; CVE-2021-3007 , and&nbsp; CVE-2020-7961 &nbsp;— were weaponized to inject and execute malicious commands in the server.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers have&nbsp; disclosed &nbsp;a series of attacks by a threat actor of Chinese origin that has targeted organizations in Russia and Hong Kong with malware — including a previously undocumented backdoor.  Attributing the campaign to&nbsp; Winnti &nbsp;(or APT41), Positive Technologies dated the first attack to May 12, 2020, when the APT used LNK shortcuts to extract and run the malware payload. A second attack detected on May 30 used a malicious RAR archive file consisting of shortcuts to two bait PDF documents claimed to be a curriculum vitae and an IELTS certificate.   The shortcuts themselves contain links to pages hosted on Zeplin, a legitimate collaboration tool for designers and developers that are used to fetch the final-stage malware that, in turn, includes a shellcode loader ("svchast.exe") and a backdoor called&nbsp; Crosswalk &nbsp;("3t54dE3r.tmp").

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers took the wraps off an ongoing surveillance campaign directed against Colombian government institutions and private companies in the energy and metallurgical industries.  In a report published by ESET on Tuesday, the Slovak internet security company said the attacks — dubbed " Operation Spalax " — began in 2020, with the modus operandi sharing some similarities to an APT group targeting the country since at least April 2018, but also different in other ways.  The overlaps come in the form of phishing emails, which have similar topics and pretend to come from some of the same entities that were used in a February 2019 operation disclosed by&nbsp; QiAnXin researchers , and subdomain names used for command-and-control (C2) servers.   However, the two campaigns diverge in the attachments used for phishing emails, the remote access trojans (RATs) deployed, and the C2 infrastructure employed to fetch the malware dropped.  The attack chain begins with the target

Cybersecurity researchers have exposed the operations of an Android malware vendor who teamed up with a second threat actor to market and sell a remote access Trojan (RAT) capable of device takeover and exfiltration of photos, locations, contacts, and messages from popular apps such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Skype, Telegram, Kik, Line, and Google Messages.  The vendor, who goes by the name of " Triangulum " in a number of darknet forums, is alleged to be a 25-year-old man of Indian origin, with the individual opening up shop to sell the malware three years ago on June 10, 2017, according to an analysis published by Check Point  Research today.  "The product was a mobile RAT, targeting Android devices and capable of exfiltration of sensitive data from a C&amp;C server, destroying local data – even deleting the entire OS, at times," the researchers said.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the investigation into the SolarWinds supply-chain attack continues, cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a third malware strain that was deployed into the build environment to inject the backdoor into the company's Orion network monitoring platform.  Called " Sunspot ," the backdoor adds to a growing list of previously disclosed malicious software such as Sunburst and Teardrop.  "This highly sophisticated and novel code was designed to inject the Sunburst malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion Platform without arousing the suspicion of our software development and build teams," SolarWinds' new CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna&nbsp; explained .   While&nbsp; preliminary evidence &nbsp;found that operators behind the espionage campaign managed to compromise the software build and code signing infrastructure of SolarWinds Orion platform as early as October 2019 to deliver the Sunburst backdoor, the latest findings reveal a new timeline that establishes the first breach of

Cybersecurity researchers, for the first time, may have found a potential connection between the backdoor used in&nbsp; the SolarWinds hack &nbsp;to a previously known malware strain.  In new&nbsp; research &nbsp;published by Kaspersky researchers today, the cybersecurity firm said it discovered several features that overlap with another backdoor known as&nbsp; Kazuar , a .NET-based malware first documented by Palo Alto Networks in 2017.  Disclosed early last month, the&nbsp; espionage campaign &nbsp;was notable for its scale and stealth, with the attackers leveraging the trust associated with SolarWinds Orion software to infiltrate government agencies and other companies so as to deploy a custom malware codenamed "Sunburst."  Shared Features Between Sunburst and Kazuar  Attribution for the SolarWinds supply-chain compromise has been difficult in part due to little-to-no clues linking the attack infrastructure to previous campaigns or other well-known threat groups.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybesecurity researchers today revealed  a new malspam campaign that distributes a remote access Trojan (RAT) by purporting to contain a sex scandal video of U.S. President Donald Trump.  The emails, which carry with the subject line "GOOD LOAN OFFER!!," come attached with a Java archive (JAR) file called "TRUMP_SEX_SCANDAL_VIDEO.jar," which, when downloaded, installs Qua or Quaverse RAT ( QRAT ) onto the infiltrated system.  "We suspect that the bad guys are attempting to ride the frenzy brought about by the recently concluded Presidential elections since the filename they used on the attachment is totally unrelated to the email's theme," Trustwave's Senior Security Researcher Diana Lopera said in a write-up published today.   The latest campaign is a variant of the Windows-based QRAT downloader Trustwave researchers&nbsp; discovered &nbsp;in August.  The infection chain starts with a spam message containing an embedded attachment or a link pointing to a m

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Cybersecurity researchers today revealed a wide-ranging scam targeting cryptocurrency users that began as early as January last year to distribute trojanized applications to install a previously undetected remote access tool on target systems.  Called ElectroRAT  by Intezer, the RAT is written from ground-up in Golang and designed to target multiple operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.&nbsp;  The apps are developed using the open-source Electron cross-platform desktop app framework.  "ElectroRAT is the latest example of attackers using Golang to develop multi-platform malware and evade most antivirus engines," the researchers said .   "It is common to see various information stealers trying to collect private keys to access victims wallets. However, it is rare to see tools written from scratch and targeting multiple operating systems for these purposes."  The campaign, first detected in December, is believed to have claimed over 6,500 victims based on th

Threat actors have been discovered distributing a new credential stealer written in AutoHotkey (AHK) scripting language as part of an ongoing campaign that started early 2020.  Customers of financial institutions in the US and Canada are among the primary targets for credential exfiltration, with a specific focus on banks such as Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Canada, HSBC, Alterna Bank, Capital One, Manulife, and EQ Bank.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The information security news cycle went into overdrive yesterday afternoon. First, Reuters revealed that the Commerce and Treasury departments suffered significant intrusions. The Washington Post soon followed up with multiple sources attributing the attack to the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVR—in particular, a portion of the SVR known as Cozy Bear—although there is no official attribution yet. Within a few hours, FireEye and Microsoft announced that this was a “supply chain attack” involving SolarWinds Orion software, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive. Today, it turns out that the attackers also compromised the Department of Homeland Security. SolarWinds revealed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the breach may affect 18,000 customers.
