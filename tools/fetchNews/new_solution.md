WhatsApp to Finally Let Users Encrypt Their Chat Backups in the Cloud<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/whatsapp-to-finally-let-users-encrypt.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
WhatsApp on Friday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;it will roll out support for end-to-end encrypted chat backups on the cloud for Android and iOS users, paving the way for storing information such as chat messages and photos in Apple iCloud or Google Drive in a cryptographically secure manner.  The feature, which will go live to all of its two billion users in the coming weeks, is expected to only work on the primary devices tied to their accounts, and not companion devices such as desktops or laptops that simply mirror the content of WhatsApp on the phones.  While the Facebook-owned messaging platform flipped the switch on end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for personal messages, calls, video chats, and media between senders and recipients&nbsp; as far back as April 2016 , the content — should a user opt to back up on the cloud to enable the transfer of chat history to a new device — wasn't subjected to the same security protections until now.   "With the introduction of end-to-end encrypted backups, Wha

The work-from-anywhere economy has opened up the possibility for your human resources team to source the best talent from anywhere. To scale their operations, organizations are leveraging the cloud to accelerate essential HR functions such as recruiting, onboarding, evaluating, and more.  SAP is leading this HR transformation with its human capital management (HCM) solution, SAP SuccessFactors. Delivering HR solutions from the cloud enables employees and administrators to not only automate typical tasks, such as providing a report on employee attrition, but also allows them to complete these tasks from anywhere and on any device.  SuccessFactors makes it easy for employees to access what they need. But the wide range of sensitive employee data within SuccessFactors creates additional security and compliance challenges. Whether it's personal and financial information used for payroll or health information for benefits, you need the right cybersecurity to ensure that sensitive data,

Researchers Propose Machine Learning-based Bluetooth Authentication Scheme<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/researchers-propose-machine-learning.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A group of academics has proposed a machine learning approach that uses authentic interactions between devices in Bluetooth networks as a foundation to handle device-to-device authentication reliably.  Called " Verification of Interaction Authenticity " (aka VIA), the recurring authentication scheme aims to solve the problem of passive, continuous authentication and automatic deauthentication once two devices are paired with one another, which remain authenticated until an explicit deauthentication action is taken, or the authenticated session expires.  "Consider devices that pair via Bluetooth, which commonly follow the pattern of pair once, trust indefinitely. After two devices connect, those devices are bonded until a user explicitly removes the bond. This bond is likely to remain intact as long as the devices exist, or until they transfer ownership," Travis Peters, one of the co-authors of the study,&nbsp; said .

How Does MTA-STS Improve Your Email Security?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/how-does-mta-sts-improve-your-email.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP has easily exploitable security loopholes. Email routing protocols were designed in a time when cryptographic technology was at a nascent stage (e.g., the de-facto protocol for email transfer, SMTP, is nearly 40 years old now), and therefore security was not an important consideration.&nbsp;  As a result, in most email systems encryption is still opportunistic, which implies that if the opposite connection does not support TLS, it gets rolled back to an unencrypted one delivering messages in plaintext.&nbsp;  To mitigate SMTP security problems,&nbsp; MTA-STS &nbsp;(Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) is the recommended email authentication standard. It enforces TLS in order to allow MTAs to send emails securely. This means that it will only allow mail from MTAs that support TLS encryption, and it will only allow mail to go to MX hosts that support TLS encryption.  In case an encrypted connection cannot be negotiated between communicating SMTP servers, the

Forget watercooler conspiracies or boardroom battles. There's a new war in the office. As companies nudge their staff to return to communal workspaces, many workers don't actually want to – more than 50 percent of employees would rather quit, according to&nbsp; research by EY .&nbsp;  While HR teams worry over the hearts and minds of staff, IT security professionals have a different battle plan to draft – how to make the new normal of the hybrid workplace secure.  The Trade-off Between Usability and Security  A company's biggest vulnerability continues to be its people. In a hybrid workplace, a Zero Trust strategy means ever-tightening security.&nbsp; The MFA a company chooses &nbsp;affects the difficulty of logging into email, dashboards, workflow tools, client documentation, and so on. Or, conversely, how porous access security is.&nbsp;  Now imagine this scenario. An employee opens a company portal, confirms a prompt on a company app on her phone, and that's it.

I'm sure you would agree that, in today's digital world, the majority of applications we work on require some type of credentials – to connect to a database with a username/password, to access computer programs via authorized tokens, or API keys to invoke services for authentication.  Credentials, or sometimes just referred to as 'Secrets,' are pieces of user or system-level confidential information that ought to be carefully protected and accessible to legitimate users only. We all know how important it is to keep these assets secure to prevent account misuse and breaches.&nbsp;  A reality check: How often do you make proactive efforts to protect these assets? Rarely, I'd say.&nbsp;  Among the worst mistakes a developer can make when it comes to application security is to accidentally commit confidential information publicly on the Internet. Surprisingly, secrets and credentials are accidentally leaked more often than you might expect, and there are intelligent tools that s

Facebook on Friday said it's extending end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for voice and video calls in Messenger, along with testing a new opt-in setting that will turn on end-to-end encryption for Instagram DMs.  "The content of your messages and calls in an end-to-end encrypted conversation is protected from the moment it leaves your device to the moment it reaches the receiver's device," Messenger's Ruth Kricheli&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a post. "This means that nobody else, including Facebook, can see or listen to what's sent or said. Keep in mind, you can report an end-to-end encrypted message to us if something's wrong."  The social media behemoth said E2EE is becoming the industry standard for improved privacy and security.   It's worth noting that the company's flagship messaging service gained support for E2EE in text chats  in 2016, when it added a " secret conversation " option to its app, while communications on its sister platform What

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Zero Trust is increasingly being adopted as the best strategy to maintain application security and prevent data breaches. To help achieve progress on Zero Trust, there is now a new, easy way to implement continuous user verification by connecting directly to the authentication systems used by mobile operators – without the overhead of processing or storing user data.&nbsp;  Before we show you how it works and how to integrate it, let's start with the fundamental challenge.  Zero Trust and Authentication  The Zero Trust model of identity verification essentially means never trusting that a returning user is whom they claim to be, regardless of their location or previous successful attempts. Zero Trust is a strategic approach to access management that is vital for keeping out bad actors.&nbsp;  As the world moves to the cloud, with an increasingly distributed network of employees, partners, and clients, tighter auth journeys become even more important.&nbsp;  But with greater security comes greate

New API Lets App Developers Authenticate Users via SIM Cards<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/new-api-lets-app-developers.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Online account creation poses a challenge for engineers and system architects: if you put up too many barriers, you risk turning away genuine users. Make it too easy, and you risk fraud or fake accounts.  The Problem with Identity Verification  The traditional model of online identity – username/email and password – has long outlived its usefulness. This is how multi-factor or two-factor authentication (MFA or 2FA) has come into play, to patch up vulnerabilities of the so-called knowledge-based model, usually by SMS passcode to verify possession of a mobile phone number.  The simplicity of SMS-based verification has taken apps by storm – it's the default option, as most users have a mobile phone. Yet bad actors have learned how to exploit this verification method, leading to the menace of&nbsp; SIM swap fraud , which is alarmingly easy to pull off and rising rapidly in incidents.  There's been no lack of effort in finding a more secure factor that is still universal. For example, b

Google on Monday announced&nbsp; new measures &nbsp;for the Play Store, including requiring developer accounts to turn on 2-Step Verification (2SV), provide an address, and verify their contact details later this year.  The new identification and two-factor authentication requirements are a step towards strengthening account security and ensuring a safe and secure app marketplace, Google Play Trust and Safety team said.   As part of the changes, individual users and businesses in possession of Google Play developer accounts will be asked to specify an account type (personal or organization), a contact name, their physical address, as well as verifying the email address and phone number provided during account creation.  In addition, the search giant is also mandating users of Google Play Console to sign in using Google's 2-Step Verification to prevent account takeover attacks.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As software supply chain attacks emerge as a point of concern in the wake of SolarWinds  and Codecov &nbsp;security incidents, Google is proposing a solution to ensure the integrity of software packages and prevent unauthorized modifications.&nbsp;  Called " Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts " (SLSA, and pronounced "salsa"), the end-to-end framework aims to secure the software development and deployment pipeline — i.e., the source ➞ build ➞ publish workflow — and&nbsp; mitigate threats &nbsp;that arise out of tampering with the source code, the build platform, and the artifact repository at every link in the chain.   Google said SLSA is inspired by the company's own internal enforcement mechanism called Binary Authorization for Borg , a set of auditing tools that verifies code provenance and implements code identity to ascertain that the deployed production software is properly reviewed and authorized.

Mozilla Begins Rolling Out 'Site Isolation' Security Feature to Firefox Browser<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/mozilla-begins-rolling-out-site.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Mozilla has begun rolling out a new security feature for its Firefox browser in nightly and beta channels that aims to protect users against a new class of side-channel attacks from malicious sites.  Called "Site Isolation," the implementation loads each website separately in its own operating system process and, as a result, prevents untrusted code from a rogue website from accessing confidential information stored in other sites.  "This fundamental redesign of Firefox's Security architecture extends current security mechanisms by creating operating system process-level boundaries for all sites loaded in Firefox for Desktop," Mozilla&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a statement. "Isolating each site into a separate operating system process makes it even harder for malicious sites to read another site's secret or private data."   The motivation for Site Isolation can be traced all the way back to January 2018 when&nbsp; Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities &nbsp;were publicly dis

A Simple 1-Click Compromised Password Reset Feature Coming to Chrome Browser<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/a-simple-1-click-compromised-password.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google on Tuesday&nbsp; announced &nbsp;a new feature to its password manager that could be used to change a stolen password automatically with a single tap.  Automated password changes build on the tool's ability to&nbsp; check the safety &nbsp;of saved passwords. Thus when Chrome finds a password that may have been compromised as part of a data breach, it will prompt users with an alert containing a "Change Password" button, tapping which "Chrome will not only navigate to the site, but also go through the entire process of changing your password."   Enabling this in the background is Google's&nbsp; Duplex &nbsp;technology, which it debuted in 2018 and expanded in 2019 to support various functions in Google Assistant like booking a rental car, ordering food, and buying movie tickets. The search giant, however, noted that users could take over control at any point during the process and change the password manually.   The feature is currently being rolled out in Chrome for Android to al

Apple May Start Delivering Security Patches Separately From Other OS Updates<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/apple-may-start-delivering-security.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Apple may be changing the way it delivers security patches to its devices running iOS and iPadOS mobile operating systems.  According to code spotted in iOS 14.5, the iPhone maker is reportedly working on a method for delivering security fixes independently of other OS updates.  The changes were first reported by&nbsp; the 9to5Mac &nbsp;website.   While Google's Android has had monthly security patches rolled out that are completely divorced from the OS-related updates, iOS has no option to install a security update without upgrading to the latest version of the OS.  But with this new setting called "Install Security Updates" added to the software update menu, it's expected that Apple will let users choose between either installing the entire iOS update or just the security updates, in a manner that echoes macOS.  On Macs running older versions of the operating system such as macOS Mojave, Apple has offered standalone update packs, allowing users to get security patches and bu

The attack surface is virtually expanding before our eyes. Protecting assets across multiple locations, with multiple solutions from different vendors, has become a daily concern for CISOs globally.&nbsp;  In a new e-book recently published ( download here ), CISOs with small security teams talk about the drivers for replacing their EDR/NGAV solutions with an Autonomous XDR solution and why they believe consolidation provides significant benefits to organization and team.&nbsp;  The first topic discussed is the need to ensure coverage and have optimal visibility in order to uncover even stealthy threats. Organizations keep adding more and more security solutions that extend visibility, yet these solutions need to be maintained, monitored, and managed, taking up quite a bit of the analyst's time.  In addition, these systems each provide some visibility leaving the analysts to make contextual connections and create the complete attack storyline. Unfortunately, these processes take time, and s

Google uncovers new iOS security feature Apple quietly added after zero-day attacks<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/google-uncovers-new-ios-security.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Google Project Zero on Thursday disclosed details of a new security mechanism that Apple quietly added to iOS 14 as a countermeasure to prevent attacks that were recently found to leverage zero-days in its messaging app.  Dubbed " BlastDoor ," the improved sandbox system for iMessage data was disclosed by Samuel Groß, a security researcher with Project Zero, a team of security researchers at Google tasked with studying zero-day vulnerabilities in hardware and software systems.  "One of the major changes in iOS 14 is the introduction of a new, tightly sandboxed 'BlastDoor' service which is now responsible for almost all parsing of untrusted data in iMessages," Groß&nbsp; said . "Furthermore, this service is written in Swift, a (mostly) memory safe language which makes it significantly harder to introduce classic memory corruption vulnerabilities into the code base."   The development is a consequence of a&nbsp; zero-click exploit &nbsp;that leveraged an Apple iMe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Creating workflows around verifying password resets can be challenging for organizations, especially since many have shifted work due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.  With the numbers of cyberattacks against businesses exploding and compromised credentials often being the culprit, companies have to bolster security around resetting passwords on user accounts.  How can organizations bolster the security of password resets for remote workers? One security workflow might involve having manager approval before IT helpdesk technicians can change a remote worker's password. In this way, the user's manager is involved in the process.  Additionally, some organizations might opt to allow managers themselves the ability to change end-user passwords. How can this be configured in Active Directory? Also, is there a more seamless solution for requiring manager approval for password resets?  Why password reset security is critical  This past year has undoubtedly created many IT helpdesk st
