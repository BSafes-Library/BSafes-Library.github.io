Here's A New Forum for Cybersecurity Leaders Outside of the Fortune 2000<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/heres-new-forum-for-cybersecurity.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Perhaps due to the nature of the position, the InfoSec leadership roles tend to be solitary ones. CISOs, or their equivalent decision-makers in organizations without the role, have so many constant drains on their attention – keeping their knowledge fresh, building plans to secure their organizations further – that they often find themselves on an island.  It's even more challenging for organizations outside the Fortune 2000 that are resource-constrained.  Security leaders are expected to know everything and often don't have anyone inside their organization with whom to bounce ideas or even go to for advice. When a crisis arises, they must often go with their gut or guess at the best solution based on their own experiences.  Security leaders could often use advice but don't have an outlet for it. Chris Roberts, Chief Security Strategist at Cynet Security, offers a new Slack-based community for InfoSec leaders ( register here ) as a solution.  The new InfoSec Leaders Community will fea

Parler said it will be back in the Apple App Store this week with approved changes, but those updates may come with the risk of losing the platform’s base users over accusations of selling out to Big Tech and losing its pro-free speech model. Speaking of free speech, a high schooler’s Snapchat about failing to make the varsity cheerleading team is at the center of a crucial First Amendment Supreme Court case. And pressure is mounting for Google to take action in line with its public statements on race, with a civil rights organization calling on the company to conduct a racial equity audit.&nbsp;

Cybersecurity Webinar: Understanding the 2020 MITRE ATT&amp;CK Results<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/cybersecurity-webinar-understanding.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The release of MITRE Engenuity's Carbanak+Fin7 ATT&amp;CK evaluations every year is a benchmark for the cybersecurity industry.  The organization's tests measure how well security vendors can detect and respond to threats and offers an independent metric for customers and security leaders to understand how well vendors perform on a variety of tasks.  However, for the uninitiated, the results can be hard to decipher and contextualize properly. Unlike many benchmarks that compare participants in a competitive manner, MITRE's framework evaluates companies exclusively on how they respond to the tests.  This means that customers must really know what they're looking for. A new webinar ( register here ) aims to provide some clarity on what to look for and how to interpret the results.&nbsp;  Cynet's new live webinar will dig a little deeper into the MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
There are many labor-intensive tasks that the IT service desk carries out on a daily basis. None as tedious and costly as resetting passwords.  Modern IT service desks spend a significant amount of time both unlocking and resetting passwords for end-users. This issue has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Causes of account lockouts and password resets  End-user password policies, such as those found in Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS), typically define a&nbsp; password age . The password age is the length of time an end-user can keep their current password.  While&nbsp; new guidance from NIST &nbsp;recommends against the long-held notion of forced password changes, it is still a common and required security mechanism across other compliance standards and industry certifications such as PCI and HITRUST.  When the password age is reached for the user account, the user must change their account password. It is generally prompted at the next login on their workstation. This sce

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For most organizations today, endpoint protection is the primary security concern. This is not unreasonable – endpoints tend to be the weakest points in an environment – but it also misses the forest for the trees. As threat surfaces expand, security professionals are harder pressed to detect threats that target other parts of an environment and can easily miss a real vulnerability by focusing too hard on endpoints.  This is why pairing tools such as next-generation antivirus (NGAV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) has become a popular, if flawed, choice. Fortunately, newer technologies and security methods offer much greater prevention and detection capabilities. This is the key argument of a new eBook ( download here ) offered by XDR provider Cynet.  The eBook, titled&nbsp; Why Autonomous XDR is Going to Replace NGAV/EDR,&nbsp; starts with a look at how NGAV and EDR tools can defend an organization with the "assume breach" mentality – expecting a breach to occur and protecting endpoi

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The concept of "passwordless" authentication has been gaining significant industry and media attention. And for a good reason. Our digital lives are demanding an ever-increasing number of online accounts and services, with security best practices dictating that each requires a strong, unique password in order to ensure data stays safe. Who wouldn't want an easier way?  That's the premise behind one-time passwords (OTP), biometrics, pin codes, and other authentication methods presented as passwordless security. Rather than remembering cumbersome passwords, users can authenticate themselves using something they own, know, or are. Some examples include a smartphone, OTP, hardware token, or biometric marker like a fingerprint. While this sounds appealing on the surface, the problem is that, when you dig deeper, these passwordless solutions are still reliant on passwords.  This happens in two primary ways:  Passwordless Solutions Rely on Passwords as a Fallback  If you ha

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the biggest consequences of the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape is that defenses must constantly build bigger systems to defend themselves.&nbsp;  This leads to both more complex systems and often less communication between them. More importantly, it can lead companies to invest in disparate "best in class" components instead of finding the best fit for their needs.  The constant arms race means that companies often get bigger, more powerful tools that can't handle the nuanced threats they face. For instance, in a car race, it's not often the fastest, most powerful car that wins, but the one that is more balanced, lighter, and more able to turn and react when needed.  In a new live webinar, Cynet Chief Strategist Chris Roberts breaks down why the philosophy of "simpler is better" is just what cybersecurity needs ( register here ).  The webinar will focus on how quickly cybersecurity stacks are growing and how this is not always a good thing. Companies are too focused

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The SolarWinds attack , which succeeded by utilizing the sunburst malware , shocked the cyber-security industry. This attack achieved persistence and was able to evade internal systems long enough to gain access to the source code of the victim.  Because of the far-reaching SolarWinds deployments, the perpetrators were also able to infiltrate many other organizations, looking for intellectual property and other assets.  Among the co-victims: US government, government contractors, Information Technology companies, and NGOs. Terabytes of data of 18,000 customers was stolen after a trojan-ized version of the SolarWinds application was installed in the internal structures of the clients.  Looking at the technical capabilities of the malware, as you will see, this particular attack was quite impressive. A particular file, named&nbsp; SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll &nbsp;is a SolarWinds digitally signed component of the Orion software framework.  The threat actors installed a backdoor that c

Behind the strategies and solutions needed to counter today's cyber threats are—dedicated cybersecurity researchers. They spend their lives dissecting code and analyzing incident reports to discover how to stop the bad guys.&nbsp;  But what drives these specialists? To understand the motivations for why these cybersecurity pros do what they do, we decided to talk with cybersecurity analysts from around the world.  To get viewpoints from across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, we recently spoke with a team of researchers from Acronis' global network of Cyber Protection Operations Centers (CPOCs):&nbsp; Candid Wüest , VP of Cyber Protection Research who is based in Switzerland;&nbsp; Alexander Ivanyuk , Senior Director, Product, and Technology Positioning, who is based in Singapore; and two Cybersecurity Analysts,&nbsp; Topher Tebow &nbsp;and&nbsp; Blake Collins , who are both based in the U.S.  The conversation yielded some interesting insights into their views of the world, how they approach cyber threat an

The data is in. According to IBM Security's&nbsp; 2020 Cost of a Data Breach Report , there is a 50% increase in cloud usage for enterprises across all industries. The number of threats targeting cloud services, predominantly collaboration services like Office 365, has&nbsp; increased 630% .

Meanwhile, political ads will once again be allowed on Facebook after an extended pause in the wake of the deadly Capitol riot. And Parler is not giving up.

Let's first take a look back at 2020!  Adding to the list of difficulties that surfaced last year, 2020 was also grim for personal data protection, as it has marked a new record number of leaked credentials and PI data.  A whopping 20 billion records were stolen in a single year, increasing 66% from 12 billion in 2019. Incredibly, this is a 9x increase from the comparatively "small" amount of 2.3 billion records stolen in 2018.  This trend seems to fit an exponential curve; even worse, we are yet to see the fallouts from the end of the year "Solorigate" campaign, which has the potential to marginalize even these numbers by the end of 2021.  Found among the leaked data are usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, healthcare information, and other personal data. Malicious actors utilize these treasure troves of information for fraud and further attacks.   In just the first quarter of 2020, the Dutch government managed to lose a hard drive

In the era of hacking and malicious actors, a company's cloud security posture is a concern that preoccupies most, if not all, organizations.  Yet even more than that, it is the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) that is critical to today's company security. Recently Malwarebytes released a statement on how they were targeted by Nation-State Actors implicated in SolarWinds breach. Their investigation suggested abuse of privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure environments.  Often left unsecured, it's SaaS setting errors like misconfigurations, inadequate legacy protocols, insufficient identity checks, credential access, and key management that leave companies open to account hijacking, insider threats, and other types of leaks or breaches in the organization.&nbsp;  Gartner has defined &nbsp;the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) category in 2020's Gartner Hype Cycle for Cloud Security as solutions that continuously assess the security risk and manage SaaS a

Phishing and Malware  Among the major cyber threats, the malware remains a significant danger. The 2017 WannaCry outbreak that cost businesses worldwide up to $4 billion is still in recent memory, and other new strains of malware are discovered on a daily basis.  Phishing has also seen a resurgence in the last few years, with many new scams being invented to take advantage of unsuspecting companies. Just one variation, the CEO Fraud email scam, cost UK businesses alone £14.8m in 2018.  Working From Home  Staff working from home are outside the direct oversight of IT support teams and often struggle to deal with cyber threats and appropriately protect company information.  Failing to update software and operating systems, sending data over insecure networks, and increasing reliance on email and online messaging has made employees far more susceptible to threats ranging from malware to phishing.

Guide: How Security Consolidation Helps Small Cybersecurity Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/guide-how-security-consolidation-helps.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The dynamic nature of cybersecurity, the changes in the threat landscape, and the expansion of the attack surface lead organizations to add more security solutions—from different vendors—creating a layered security infrastructure that introduces new challenges to any team, with a much more significant impact on small ones.  And yet, sophisticated attacks continue to bypass these advanced security layers while FOMO (fear of missing out) compels security teams to evaluate every new solution that comes out.  A new guide, "How Security Consolidation Helps Small Security Teams" ( download here ), reviews the challenges of a layered, multi-vendor security approach for protecting your internal environment and reveals why the concept of consolidation of security solutions is becoming the go-to security approach of many CISOs with small teams.  Having a single consolidated solution for protecting your internal environment can free up much of your small team's time and reduce your

Security Operations is a 24 x 7 job. It does not stop for weekends or holidays or even that much-needed coffee break after the first hour of the shift is complete. We all know this.  Every SOC engineer is hoping for some rest at some point. One of my favorite jokes when talking about Security Operations is "3 SOC engineers walked into a bar…" That the joke. No SOC engineers have time to do that. They get it. They laugh. So why is this all true?  Let us explore that a little bit.   Demand for experienced SOC engineers far surpasses the available talent.  Event volume levels boggle the imagination compared to even just a few years ago.  Utilization of tools to their utmost capability has often not been a priority.&nbsp;   In the Security Operations space, we have been using SIEM's for many years with varying degrees of deployments, customization, and effectiveness. For the most part, they have been a helpful tool for Security Operations. But they can be better. Like any tool, t

The pressure on small to medium-sized enterprises to protect their organizations against cyberthreats is astronomical. These businesses face the same threats as the largest enterprises, experience the same (relative) damages and consequences when breaches occur as the largest enterprises but are forced to protect their organizations with a fraction of the resources as the largest enterprises.&nbsp;  Cybersecurity company Cynet just released findings from a survey of 200 CISOs in charge of small security teams ( Download here ) to shine "a spotlight into the challenges of small security teams everywhere."  In addition to better understanding the challenges these CISOs face, the 2021 Survey of CISOs with Small Security Teams delves into the strategies CISOs will employ to ensure their organizations are protected from the ongoing onslaught of cyber threats - all while saddled with limited budgets and headcount.

Nation-state hacker groups mounted attacks against organizations involved in the coronavirus pandemic response, including the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some in an attempt to politicize the pandemic.  Even garden-variety cyber attacks like email phishing, social engineering, and refund theft took on a darker flavor in response to the widespread economic precarity brought on by the pandemic.&nbsp;  "Hackers were mostly trying to take advantage of people's fear by offering medical equipment like thermometers and masks for cheap, low

In the Wake of the SolarWinds Hack, Here's How Businesses Should Respond<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/in-wake-of-solarwinds-hack-heres-how.html"> Full Text</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Throughout 2020, businesses, in general, have had their hands full with IT challenges. They had to rush to accommodate a sudden shift to remote work. Then they had to navigate a rapid adoption of automation technologies.  And as the year came to a close, more businesses began trying to assemble the safety infrastructure required to return to some semblance of normal in 2021.  But at the end of the year,&nbsp; news of a massive breach &nbsp;of IT monitoring software vendor SolarWinds introduced a new complication – the possibility of a wave of secondary data breaches and cyber-attacks. And because SolarWinds' products have a presence in so many business networks, the size of the threat is massive.  So far, though, most of the attention is getting paid to large enterprises like Microsoft and Cisco (and the US Government), who were the primary target of the SolarWinds breach.

Most companies with small security teams face the same issues. They have inadequate budgets, inadequate staff, and inadequate skills to face today's onslaught of sophisticated cyberthreats.  Many of these companies turn to virtual CISOs (vCISOs) to provide security expertise and guidance. vCISOs are typically former CISOs with years of experience building and managing information security programs across large and small organizations.  Autonomous XDR company Cynet, a provider of an automated breach protection platform and MDR service for even the smallest security teams, is conducting a webinar with well-known vCISO Brian Haugli to understand the common challenges faced by CISOs with small security teams [ register here ].  In the first part of the webinar, Haugli will share the four foundational risks that are common across most companies he helps.

Enhancing Email Security with MTA-STS and SMTP TLS Reporting<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/enhancing-email-security-with-mta-sts.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In 1982, when SMTP was first specified, it did not contain any mechanism for providing security at the transport level to secure communications between mail transfer agents.  Later, in 1999, the STARTTLS command was added to SMTP that in turn supported the encryption of emails in between the servers, providing the ability to convert a non-secure connection into a secure one that is encrypted using TLS protocol.  However, encryption is optional in SMTP, which implies that emails can be sent in plaintext.&nbsp; Mail Transfer Agent-Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) &nbsp;is a relatively new standard that enables mail service providers the ability to enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure SMTP connections and to specify whether the sending SMTP servers should refuse to deliver emails to MX hosts that that does not offer TLS with a reliable server certificate. It has been proven to successfully mitigate TLS downgrade attacks and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.  SMTP TLS Reporting (TLS-

Pen Testing By Numbers: Tracking Pen Testing Trends and Challenges<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/pen-testing-by-numbers-tracking-pen.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over the years,&nbsp; penetration testing &nbsp;has had to change and adapt alongside the IT environments and technology that need to be assessed.  Broad cybersecurity issues often influence the strategy and growth of pen-testing. In such a fast-paced field, organizations get real value from learning about others' penetration testing experiences, identifying trends, and the role they play in today's threat landscape.  While there is much to be gained from a single snapshot, additional value can come from long term data collection and year over year comparisons. We can see whether the effects that recent trends have on pen testing are long term, or simply a temporary shift, and how they affect the continuing evolution of penetration testing. For instance, 2020 saw a massive influx of remote work.  Unfortunately, the convenience of working safely from home increased the risk of a breach as countless new attack vectors opened up, both from the way employees connected to networks, as well a

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Like it or not, 2020 was the year that proved that teams could work from literally anywhere.  While terms like "flex work" and "WFH" were thrown around before COVID-19 came around, thanks to the pandemic, remote working has become the defacto way people work nowadays. Today, digital-based work interactions take the place of in-person ones with near-seamless fluidity, and the best part is that going remote helps companies save their cash in this bootstrapped time.&nbsp;  But while the ability to work from anywhere has truly been essential to keeping businesses and the economy functional, it has opened up new challenges that need to be addressed.&nbsp;  Your Devices Are Your Weakest Link  With nearly ⅔ of employees still working remotely to some degree, the boundaries that once separated work and home have been completely washed away. A major ramification of this shift has been an increase in the volume of corporate and non-corporate devices connecting from remote to sensitive

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
End-user passwords are one of the weakest components of your overall security protocols. Most users tend to reuse passwords across work and personal accounts.  They may also choose relatively weak passwords that satisfy company password policies but can be easily guessed or brute-forced. Your users may also inadvertently use&nbsp; breached passwords &nbsp;for their corporate account password.  The&nbsp; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) &nbsp;has a cybersecurity framework that helps organizations address common cybersecurity pitfalls in their environment, including weak, reused, and breached passwords. This post will take a closer look at the NIST password guidelines and see how you can effectively audit your password policies to ensure these meet the standards recommended by NIST.  NIST Password Guidelines and Best Practices  Specific guidance around passwords is addressed within the chapter titled&nbsp; Memorized Secret Verifiers .
