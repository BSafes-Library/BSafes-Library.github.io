Cybersecurity is one of the most important topics on the global agenda, boosted by the pandemic. As the global digitalisation is further accelerating, the world is becoming ever more interconnected. Digital ecosystems are being created all around us: countries, corporations and individuals are taking advantage of the rapid spread of the Internet and smart devices. In this context, a single vulnerable link is enough to bring down the entire system, just like the domino effect.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For years, security professionals have recognized the need to enhance SaaS security. However, the exponential adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications over 2020 turned slow-burning embers into a raging fire.&nbsp;  Organizations manage anywhere from thirty-five to more than a hundred applications. From collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams to mission-critical applications like SAP and Salesforce, SaaS applications act as the foundation of the modern enterprise. 2020 created an urgent need for security solutions that mitigate SaaS misconfiguration risks.  Recognizing the importance of SaaS security, Gartner named a new category, SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM), to distinguish solutions that have the capabilities to offer a continuous assessment of security risks arising from a SaaS application's deployment.&nbsp;  To understand how security teams are currently dealing with their SaaS security posture and what their main concerns are, Adaptive Shield, a leading S

[Whitepaper] XDR vs. NDR/NTA – What do Organizations Truly Need to Stay Safe?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/whitepaper-xdr-vs-ndrnta-what-do.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security teams whose organizations are outside the Fortune 500 are faced with a dilemma. Most teams will have to choose between deploying either a network traffic analysis (NTA) or network detection and response (NDR) tool or an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to supplement their existing stacks.  On the other hand, some organizations are getting the best of both options by switching to extended detection and response (XDR) tools which often provide all these tools in one solution.  This is the key takeaway of a new whitepaper by security provider Cynet ( download it here ).  NDR tools have become more popular, and for a good reason. They offer organizations a variety of benefits and can help further secure an environment from lateral movement attacks and further infiltration if an initial attack succeeds. NDR tools can detect a wide range of malicious activities and anomalous behaviors.&nbsp;  The question is whether the strengths of an NDR tool outweigh its limitations.&nbsp;  The

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Securing applications it the API-first era can be an uphill battle. As development accelerates, accountability becomes unclear, and getting controls to operate becomes a challenge in itself. It's time that we rethink our application security strategies to reflect new priorities, principles and processes in the API-first era. Securing tomorrow's applications begins with assessing the business risks today.  The trends and risks shaping today's applications  As the world continues to become more and more interconnected via devices — and the APIs that connect them — individuals are growing accustomed to the frictionless experience that they provide. While this frictionless reality is doubtlessly more user-friendly, i.e., faster and more convenient, it also requires a trade-off. This convenience demands openness, and openness is a risk when it comes to cybersecurity.  According to&nbsp; Sidney Gottesman , Mastercard's SVP for Security Innovation, the above situation leads to one

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The recent tsunami of ransomware has brought to life the fears of downtime and data loss cybersecurity pros have warned about, as attacks on the energy sector, food supply chain, healthcare industry, and other critical infrastructure have grabbed headlines.  For the industry experts who track the evolution of this threat, the increased frequency, sophistication, and destructiveness of ransomware suggests that businesses still have some major gaps in their defense strategies.  It's no surprise that a new, multi-layered approach to protection is needed to stem the damage caused by ransomware. But what changes should an IT team implement to close those gaps?  During a recent panel, a team of cybersecurity experts outlined a three-step plan to do just that -- centered around embracing new technologies, improving security processes, and ensuring their people know how to help curb the threat.  1&nbsp; —&nbsp; New Strains Overwhelm Old Defenses  Many new ransomware strains now act like advanced pe

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Enterprise applications used to live securely in data centers and office employees connected to internal networks using company-managed laptops or desktops. And data was encircled by a walled perimeter to keep everything safe.  All that changed in the last 18 months. Businesses and employees had to adapt quickly to cloud technology and remote work. The cloud gave businesses the agility to respond faster to change and the scale to accommodate rapid growth. Remote work boosted productivity by letting employees access cloud data from anywhere on any device.  This is not business as usual. The data center and the perimeter security are no longer the center of the universe. Now remote workers, personal mobile devices, applications, and data are in the middle.  Although employees, applications, and data have left the building, IT security teams still shoulder the responsibility for protecting confidential data and ensuring compliance with strict privacy regulations. The risk of not doing so

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Controversial mogul and antivirus pioneer John McAfee on Wednesday died by suicide in a jail cell in Barcelona, hours after reports that he would be extradited to face federal charges in the U.S.  McAfee was 75. He is said to have died by hanging "as his nine months in prison brought him to despair," according to McAfee's lawyer Javier Villalba, Reuters&nbsp; reported . Security personnel at the Brians 2 prison tried to revive McAfee, but he was eventually declared dead, per&nbsp; Associated Press .   News of his death comes after Spain's National Court approved his extradition to the U.S. to face federal criminal tax evasion charges.  McAfee worked for NASA, Xerox, and Lockheed Martin before launching the world's first commercial antivirus software in 1987. He later resigned from the namesake security firm in 1994.   The former cybersecurity tycoon turned fugitive was detained in Spain last October for " willful failure to file tax returns ," with the U.S. Depar

It seems like every new day brings with it a new ransomware news item – new attacks, methods, horror stories, and data being leaked.  Ransomware attacks are on the rise, and they've become a major issue for organizations across industries. A recent report estimated that by 2031, ransomware attacks would cost the world over $260 billion.  A new whitepaper from XDR provider Cynet demonstrates how the company's platform can help organizations mitigate the impact of ransomware ( download here ).  Today, attackers have shown themselves to be less interested in ignoring the most vulnerable sectors, such as health care providers and hospitals. With a parallel increase in the number of variants – Wastedlocker, FTCode, Tycooon, TrickBot, REvil, and many others – it's becoming harder to defend against the growing threat of ransomware.  Ransomware operates by using a variety of infection and encryption techniques to steal or barricade companies' files behind hard paywalls. Even t

The key federal cybersecurity agency acknowledged the massive SolarWinds hack, which led to the compromise of nine federal agencies by Russian hackers, might have been deterred if a basic security measure had been put in place.

A wireless network naming bug has been discovered in Apple's iOS operating system that effectively disables an iPhone's ability to connect to a Wi-Fi network.  The issue was spotted by security researcher&nbsp; Carl Schou , who found that the phone's Wi-Fi functionality gets permanently disabled after joining a Wi-Fi network with the unusual name " %p%s%s%s%s%n " even after rebooting the phone or changing the network's name (i.e., service set identifier or SSID).   The bug could have serious implications in that bad actors could exploit the issue to plant fraudulent Wi-Fi hotspots with the name in question to break the device's wireless networking features.  After joining my personal WiFi with the SSID "%p%s%s%s%s%n", my iPhone permanently disabled it's WiFi functionality. Neither rebooting nor changing SSID fixes it :~) pic.twitter.com/2eue90JFu3 — Carl Schou (@vm_call) June 18, 2021   The issue stems from a&nbsp; string formatting &nbsp;bug in the manner iOS parses th

[eBook] 7 Signs You Might Need a New Detection and Response Tool<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/ebook-7-signs-you-might-need-new.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
It's natural to get complacent with the status quo when things seem to be working. The familiar is comfortable, and even if something better comes along, it brings with it many unknowns.  In cybersecurity, this tendency is countered by the fast pace of innovation and how quickly technology becomes obsolete, often overnight.  This combination usually results in one of two things – organizations make less than ideal choices about the software and tools they're adding, or security leaders simply cannot stay abreast of new developments and opt to stay put with their existing stack.  The problem is that once you let one update pass you by, you're suddenly miles behind. A new eBook from XDR provider Cynet ( download here ) offers insights into factors that are clear signs organizations need to upgrade their detection and response tools to stay with the times.

A solid password policy is the first line of defense for your corporate network. Protecting your systems from unauthorized users may sound easy on the surface, but it can actually be quite complicated. You have to balance password security with usability, while also following various regulatory requirements.  Companies in the EU must have password policies that are compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Even if your company isn't based in the EU, these requirements apply if you have employees or customers residing in the EU or customers purchasing there.  In this post, we will look at GDPR requirements for passwords and provide practical tips on how to design your password policy. Remember, even if GDPR isn't required for you now, the fundamentals of a data protection regulation plan can help strengthen your organization's security.&nbsp;  Password requirements for GDPR compliance  You may be surprised to discover that the GDPR laws do not actually mentio

Live Cybersecurity Webinar — Deconstructing Cobalt Strike<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/live-cybersecurity-webinar.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Organizations' cybersecurity capabilities have improved over the past decade, mostly out of necessity. As their defenses get better, so do the methods, tactics, and techniques malicious actors devise to penetrate their environments.  Instead of the standard virus or trojan, attackers today will deploy a variety of tools and methods to infiltrate an organization's environment and attack it from the inside.  In an interesting twist of fate, one of the tools organizations have used to audit and improve their defenses has also become a popular tool attackers use to infiltrate. Cobalt Strike is an Adversary Simulation and Red Team Operations tool that allows organizations to simulate advanced attacks and test their security stacks in a close-to-real-world simulation.  A new research webinar from XDR provider Cynet ( register here ) offers a better look at Cobalt Strike. The webinar, led by Cyber Operations Analyst for the Cynet MDR Team Yuval Fischer, will take a deep dive into the thr

Bolstering password policies in your organization is an important part of a robust cybersecurity strategy. Cybercriminals are using compromised accounts as one of their favorite tactics to infiltrate business-critical environments; as we've seen in recent news, these attacks can be dangerous and financially impactful.  Unfortunately, account compromise is a very successful attack method and requires much less effort than other attack vectors.  One of the essential types of password protection recommended by noted cybersecurity standards is&nbsp; breached password detection . Hackers often use known breached password lists in credential stuffing or password spraying attacks.  Here are some critical criteria to consider when your sysadmins are evaluating breached password protection solutions.&nbsp;  Breached password recommendations  In the last few years, password security recommendations have evolved past the traditional recommendations regarding password security.&nbsp;  Businesses have used M

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The speed at which malicious actors have improved their attack tactics and continue to penetrate security systems has made going bigger the major trend in cybersecurity.  Facing an evolving threat landscape, organizations have responded by building bigger security stacks, adding more tools and platforms, and making their defenses more complex—a new eBook from XDR provider Cynet ( read it here ).  Organizations find themselves in a virtual arms race with malicious actors. Attackers find new, stealthier ways to penetrate an organization's defenses, and organizations build higher walls, buy more technologies to protect themselves, and expand their security stacks.  Money is a key component of security success – a tough reality for leaner organizations that might not have the seemingly endless budgets of larger corporations and enterprises.  The question of what leaner security teams could do about it used to be "not a lot," but today, that's hardly the case. Even though

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
An ongoing cyber-espionage operation with suspected ties to China has been found targeting a Southeast Asian government to deploy spyware on Windows systems while staying under the radar for more than three years.  "In this campaign, the attackers utilized the set of Microsoft Office exploits and loaders with anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to install a previously unknown backdoor on victim's machines," researchers from Check Point  Research said in a report published today.  The infection chain works by sending decoy documents, impersonating other entities within the government, to multiple members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which, when opened, retrieves a next-stage payload from the attacker's server that contains an encrypted downloader. The downloader, in turn, gathers and exfiltrates system information to a remote server that subsequently responds back with a shellcode loader.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The unfortunate truth is that while companies are investing more in cyber defenses and taking cybersecurity more seriously than ever, successful breaches and ransomware attacks are on the rise. While a successful breach is not inevitable, it is becoming more likely despite best efforts to prevent it from happening.&nbsp;  Just as it wasn't raining when Noah built the ark, companies must face the fact that they need to prepare - and educate the organization on - a well-thought-out response plan if a successful cyberattack does occur. Obviously, the worst time to plan your response to a cyberattack is when it happens.  With so many companies falling victim to cyberattacks, an entire cottage industry of Incident Response (IR) services has arisen. Thousands of IR engagements have helped surface best practices and preparedness guides to help those that have yet to fall victim to a cyberattack.&nbsp;  Recently, cybersecurity company Cynet provided an&nbsp; Incident Response plan Word template &nbsp;to help com

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Are you aware of how secure your domain is? In most organizations, there is an assumption that their domains are secure and within a few months, but the truth soon dawns on them that it isn't.  Spotting someone spoofing your domain name is one way to determine if your security is unsatisfactory - this means that someone is impersonating you (or confusing some of your recipients) and releasing false information. You may ask, "But why should I care?" Because these spoofing activities can potentially endanger your reputation.  With so many companies being targeted by domain impersonators, email domain spoofing shouldn't be taken lightly. By doing so, they could put themselves, as well as their clients, at risk.&nbsp;  Your domain's security rating can make a huge difference in whether or not you get targeted by phishers looking to make money quickly or to use your domain and brand to spread ransomware without you knowing it!

Russian-language dark web marketplace Hydra has emerged as a hotspot for illicit activities, pulling in a whopping $1.37 billion worth of cryptocurrencies in 2020, up from $9.4 million in 2016.  The "blistering growth" in annual transaction volumes marks a staggering 624% year-over-year jump over a three-year period from 2018 to 2020.  "Further buoying Hydra's growth is its ability—or its good fortune—to remain running and unscathed against competitor attacks or&nbsp; law enforcement scrutiny ; its only downtime of note occurred during a short time period at the beginning of the COVID-19 global pandemic in late March 2020," threat intelligence firm Flashpoint&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a report jointly published with blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.   Active since 2015, Hydra opened as a competitor to the now-defunct Russian Anonymous Marketplace (aka RAMP), primarily facilitating narcotics trade, before becoming a bazaar for all things criminal, including offering BTC cash-out

There is a person in every organization that is the direct owner of breach protection. His or her task is to oversee and govern the process of design, build, maintain, and continuously enhance the security level of the organization.   Title-wise, this person is most often either the CIO, CISO, or Directory of IT. For convenience, we'll refer to this individual as the CISO.   This person is the subject-matter expert in understanding the standard set of active cyber risks, benchmarking to what degree the organization's exposure influences potential impact. They then take appropriate steps to ensure the major risks are addressed.   On top of being engaged 24/7 in the organization's actual breach protection activity, the CISO has another critical task: to articulate the risks, potential impacts and appropriate steps to take to the company's management – or in other words, they must effectively translate security issues for non-security-savvy executives in a clear and busi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
If there's one thing all great SaaS platforms share in common, it's their focus on simplifying the lives of their end-users. Removing friction for users in a safe way is the mission of single sign-on (SSO) providers.  With SSO at the helm, users don't have to remember separate passwords for each app or hide the digital copies of the credentials in plain sight.  SSO also frees up the IT's bandwidth from handling recurring password reset requests while improving productivity for everyone in your organization. However, there is also a level of risk that comes with SSO capability.&nbsp;  How to protect against SSO fails  Real-Life Risks Involved in SSO&nbsp;  While SSO facilitates ease of access to a great extent, it also comes with some amount of imminent risk. SSO is a good enabler of efficiency, but not the end-all security solution with its own flaws that allow for bypass.  There's a specific class of vulnerability that Adam Roberts from the NCC Group detected in several SSO

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Leaders in the InfoSec field face a strange dilemma. On the one hand, there are hundreds of thousands of resources available to find online to read (or watch) if they have questions – that's a benefit of a digital-first field. On the other hand, most leaders face challenges that – while not entirely unique each time – tend to require a specific touch or solution.  For most, it would be great to have a sympathetic ear or a fresh perspective that has faced similar challenges. Where does the tip of the spear turn to for a helping hand?  One popular avenue is to turn to a virtual CISO (or vCISO), an external consultant who can offer strategic advice, suggestions and help find insights that can be instrumental in building better security systems.  For many organizations, having the benefits of a CISO, even on a temporary basis, can be incredibly helpful and valuable.  With that in mind, Chris Roberts, Cynet's chief security strategist, is offering a new program ( you can learn more

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
A total of 158 privacy and security issues have been identified in 58 Android stalkware apps from various vendors that could enable a malicious actor to take control of a victim's device, hijack a stalker's account, intercept data, achieve remote code execution, and even frame the victim by uploading fabricated evidence.  The new findings, which come from an analysis of 86 stalkerware apps for the Android platform undertaken by Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET, highlight the unintended consequences of a practice that's not only unethical but in the process could also expose private and intimate information of the victims and leave them at risk of cyberattacks and fraud.  "Since there could be a close relationship between stalker and victim, the stalker's private information could also be exposed," ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko&nbsp; said &nbsp;in a Monday write-up.

Why Password Hygiene Needs a Reboot<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/why-password-hygiene-needs-reboot.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In today's digital world, password security is more important than ever. While biometrics, one-time passwords (OTP), and other emerging forms of authentication are often touted as replacements to the traditional password, today, this concept is more marketing hype than anything else.  But just because&nbsp; passwords aren't going anywhere anytime soon &nbsp;doesn't mean that organizations don't need to modernize their approach to password hygiene right now.&nbsp;  The Compromised Credential Crisis  As Microsoft's&nbsp; security team put it , "All it takes is one compromised credential…to cause a data breach." Coupled with the rampant problem of password reuse, compromised passwords can have a significant and long-lasting impact on enterprise security.  In fact, researchers from Virginia Tech University found that over 70% of users employed a compromised password for other accounts up to a year after it was initially leaked, with 40% reusing passwords that were leaked over three years ago.

A worker at Amazon’s Bessemer, Ala. facility dropped a big allegation about security guards having access to a mailbox during the unionization election at a National Labor Relations Board hearing Friday. Meanwhile, Facebook lost a bid to block an Irish watchdog's draft decision that could suspend the tech giant’s ability to transfer data from the U.S. to the EU, and bipartisan groups of House lawmakers rolled out two pieces of legislation to protect critical infrastructure against cyberattacks following the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline.&nbsp;

Report to Your Management with the Definitive 'Incident Response for Management' Presentation Template<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2019/10/cybersecurity-incident-response.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Security incidents occur. It's not a matter of 'if' but of 'when.' There are security products and procedures that were implemented to optimize the IR process, so from the 'security-professional' angle, things are taken care of.   However, many security pros who are doing an excellent job in handling incidents find effectively communicating the ongoing process with their management a much more challenging task.   It's a little surprise — managements are typically not security savvy and don't really care about the bits and bytes in which the security pro masters. Cynet addresses this gap with the IR Reporting for Management PPT template , providing CISOs and CIOs with a clear and intuitive tool to report both the ongoing IR process and its conclusion.   The IR for Management template enables CISOs and CIOs to communicate with the two key points that management cares about—assurance that the incident is under control and a clear understanding of imp

Big Cybersecurity Tips For Remote Workers Who Use Their Own Tech<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/big-cybersecurity-tips-for-remote.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As the total number of people working from home has grown dramatically in the last year or two, so has the number of individuals who use all of their own technology for their jobs. If you're a remote worker who relies on your own PC to get your work done, then you may be at a heightened risk for some of the major threats that are impacting the computer industry as a whole.  Relatively few people take all of the recommended precautions when using their own technology. While it's unlikely that people are engaged in any riskier behaviors than they were before, the fact that few people have the time to follow all the relevant pieces of cybersecurity news means some people might be unaware of certain active threats. That may explain how a password manager was&nbsp; used to install malicious code &nbsp;on a large number of client machines.  Though you might not want to follow all of the news that comes out about security issues on a daily basis, you might find it helpful to pay close attentio

Can Data Protection Systems Prevent Data At Rest Leakage?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/can-data-protection-systems-prevent.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Protection against insider risks works when the process involves controlling the data transfer channels or examining data sources.  One approach involves preventing USB flash drives from being copied or sending them over email. The second one concerns preventing leakage or fraud in which an insider accesses files or databases with harmful intentions.  What's the best way to protect your data?  It seems obvious that prevention is the best way to solve any problem. In most cases, DCAP (data-centric audit and protection) and DAM (database activity monitoring) is sufficient. Both serve the purpose of protecting data at rest.  The following example illustrates the approach we found in the Russian legal system.  An employee of the Federal Migration Service in one of the Russian regions was approached by his friend, who asked him to hide information about two offenses in his file in the migrant database. The employee knew that this could be done remotely, accessed the database from home,

LIVE Webinar — The Rabbit Hole of Automation<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/live-webinar-rabbit-hole-of-automation.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The concept of automation has taken on a life of its own in recent years. The idea is nothing new, but the current interest in automation is a mix of both hype and innovation.  On the one hand, it's much easier today to automate everything from small processes to massive-scale tasks than it's ever been before. On the other hand, are we really prepared to hand the reins over to completely automated systems, and should we?  There are areas in security operations where automation is already a critical component. In terms of analytics and parsing through ever-expanding data flows, it's impossible for most teams to keep up without impacting other areas of their jobs. Automated systems help us make sense of threats much faster and more reliably. However, automation isn't a cure-all (just yet). A new live webinar from XDR provider Cynet dives into the topic more in depth ( register here ).  The webinar explores automation as it exists today in the cybersecurity industry. Led

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For as long as corporate IT has been in existence, users have been required to change their passwords periodically. In fact, the need for scheduled password changes may be one of the most long-standing of all IT best practices.  Recently, however, things have started to change. Microsoft has reversed course on the best practices that it has had in place for decades and&nbsp; no longer recommends that organizations require users to change passwords periodically . Organizations are being forced to consider, perhaps for the first time, whether or not requiring periodic password changes is a good idea.  Microsoft password reset recommendations  According to Microsoft, requiring users to change their passwords frequently does more harm than good.&nbsp;  Humans are notoriously resistant to change. When a user is forced to change their password, they will often come up with a new password that is based on their previous password. A user might, for example, append a number to the end of their password

InfoSec leaders tend to be a specific type. Their jobs require them to think of possible threats, take actions that may not pay immediate results, plan for unknown security risks, and react quickly when emergencies arise, often before the morning's first coffee.  The high-stakes position also means that CISOs need to keep their knowledge and skills sharp – you can never really know what's around the corner.  So, what can security leaders do to make sure they're prepared and hone their skills ahead of the next inevitable threat? Now, they can test themselves and their knowledge at a new website, 'The CISO Challenge' ( visit it here ). The website, launched by XDR provider Cynet, aims to let information security leaders test their cybersecurity mettle.

How Should the Service Desk Reset Passwords?<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/how-should-service-desk-reset-passwords.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Ask the average helpdesk technician what they do all day, and they will probably answer by saying that they reset passwords. Sure, helpdesk technicians do plenty of other things too, but in many organizations, a disproportionate number of helpdesk calls are tied to password resets.  On the surface, having a&nbsp; helpdesk technician reset a user's password &nbsp;probably doesn't seem like a big deal. After all, the technician simply opens Active Directory Users and Computers, right-clicks on the user account, and chooses the Reset Password command from the shortcut menu. Resetting a password in this way is an easy process. Organizations can even opt to use an alternative tool such as the Windows Admin Center or even PowerShell if they prefer.  One thing that most people probably don't stop and think about, however, is that even though the steps involved in the password reset process are simple enough, the&nbsp; process as a whole constitutes a major security risk .

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Perhaps due to the nature of the position, the InfoSec leadership roles tend to be solitary ones. CISOs, or their equivalent decision-makers in organizations without the role, have so many constant drains on their attention – keeping their knowledge fresh, building plans to secure their organizations further – that they often find themselves on an island.  It's even more challenging for organizations outside the Fortune 2000 that are resource-constrained.  Security leaders are expected to know everything and often don't have anyone inside their organization with whom to bounce ideas or even go to for advice. When a crisis arises, they must often go with their gut or guess at the best solution based on their own experiences.  Security leaders could often use advice but don't have an outlet for it. Chris Roberts, Chief Security Strategist at Cynet Security, offers a new Slack-based community for InfoSec leaders ( register here ) as a solution.  The new InfoSec Leaders Community will fea

Cybersecurity Webinar: Understanding the 2020 MITRE ATT&amp;CK Results<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/cybersecurity-webinar-understanding.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The release of MITRE Engenuity's Carbanak+Fin7 ATT&amp;CK evaluations every year is a benchmark for the cybersecurity industry.  The organization's tests measure how well security vendors can detect and respond to threats and offers an independent metric for customers and security leaders to understand how well vendors perform on a variety of tasks.  However, for the uninitiated, the results can be hard to decipher and contextualize properly. Unlike many benchmarks that compare participants in a competitive manner, MITRE's framework evaluates companies exclusively on how they respond to the tests.  This means that customers must really know what they're looking for. A new webinar ( register here ) aims to provide some clarity on what to look for and how to interpret the results.&nbsp;  Cynet's new live webinar will dig a little deeper into the MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluation. The company's research team will break down how the evaluations work, what the results mean, an

There are many labor-intensive tasks that the IT service desk carries out on a daily basis. None as tedious and costly as resetting passwords.  Modern IT service desks spend a significant amount of time both unlocking and resetting passwords for end-users. This issue has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Causes of account lockouts and password resets  End-user password policies, such as those found in Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS), typically define a&nbsp; password age . The password age is the length of time an end-user can keep their current password.  While&nbsp; new guidance from NIST &nbsp;recommends against the long-held notion of forced password changes, it is still a common and required security mechanism across other compliance standards and industry certifications such as PCI and HITRUST.  When the password age is reached for the user account, the user must change their account password. It is generally prompted at the next login on their workstation. This sce

</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For most organizations today, endpoint protection is the primary security concern. This is not unreasonable – endpoints tend to be the weakest points in an environment – but it also misses the forest for the trees. As threat surfaces expand, security professionals are harder pressed to detect threats that target other parts of an environment and can easily miss a real vulnerability by focusing too hard on endpoints.  This is why pairing tools such as next-generation antivirus (NGAV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) has become a popular, if flawed, choice. Fortunately, newer technologies and security methods offer much greater prevention and detection capabilities. This is the key argument of a new eBook ( download here ) offered by XDR provider Cynet.  The eBook, titled&nbsp; Why Autonomous XDR is Going to Replace NGAV/EDR,&nbsp; starts with a look at how NGAV and EDR tools can defend an organization with the "assume breach" mentality – expecting a breach to occur and protecting endpoi

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The concept of "passwordless" authentication has been gaining significant industry and media attention. And for a good reason. Our digital lives are demanding an ever-increasing number of online accounts and services, with security best practices dictating that each requires a strong, unique password in order to ensure data stays safe. Who wouldn't want an easier way?  That's the premise behind one-time passwords (OTP), biometrics, pin codes, and other authentication methods presented as passwordless security. Rather than remembering cumbersome passwords, users can authenticate themselves using something they own, know, or are. Some examples include a smartphone, OTP, hardware token, or biometric marker like a fingerprint. While this sounds appealing on the surface, the problem is that, when you dig deeper, these passwordless solutions are still reliant on passwords.  This happens in two primary ways:  Passwordless Solutions Rely on Passwords as a Fallback  If you ha

Simplify, then Add Lightness – Consolidating the Technology to Better Defend Ourselves<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/simplify-then-add-lightness.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
One of the biggest consequences of the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape is that defenses must constantly build bigger systems to defend themselves.&nbsp;  This leads to both more complex systems and often less communication between them. More importantly, it can lead companies to invest in disparate "best in class" components instead of finding the best fit for their needs.  The constant arms race means that companies often get bigger, more powerful tools that can't handle the nuanced threats they face. For instance, in a car race, it's not often the fastest, most powerful car that wins, but the one that is more balanced, lighter, and more able to turn and react when needed.  In a new live webinar, Cynet Chief Strategist Chris Roberts breaks down why the philosophy of "simpler is better" is just what cybersecurity needs ( register here ).  The webinar will focus on how quickly cybersecurity stacks are growing and how this is not always a good thing. Companies are too focused

The SolarWinds attack , which succeeded by utilizing the sunburst malware , shocked the cyber-security industry. This attack achieved persistence and was able to evade internal systems long enough to gain access to the source code of the victim.  Because of the far-reaching SolarWinds deployments, the perpetrators were also able to infiltrate many other organizations, looking for intellectual property and other assets.  Among the co-victims: US government, government contractors, Information Technology companies, and NGOs. Terabytes of data of 18,000 customers was stolen after a trojan-ized version of the SolarWinds application was installed in the internal structures of the clients.  Looking at the technical capabilities of the malware, as you will see, this particular attack was quite impressive. A particular file, named&nbsp; SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll &nbsp;is a SolarWinds digitally signed component of the Orion software framework.  The threat actors installed a backdoor that c

Password security has long been an issue for businesses and their cybersecurity standards. Account passwords are often the weakest link in the overall security posture for many organizations.  Many companies have used Microsoft's default password policies for decades. While these can be customized, businesses often accept the default values for their organization.  The Windows default password policy is a good start, but are there security vulnerabilities associated with it? Let's look at the current recommendations from leading cybersecurity authorities and see how they measure up against the Windows default password policy.  Windows default password policy settings  Many, if not most, business environments today use Microsoft Active Directory as their identity and access management solution in the enterprise.

Adding to the list of difficulties that surfaced last year, 2020 was also grim for personal data protection, as it has marked a new record number of leaked credentials and PI data.  A whopping 20 billion records were stolen in a single year, increasing 66% from 12 billion in 2019.

In the era of hacking and malicious actors, a company's cloud security posture is a concern that preoccupies most, if not all, organizations.  Yet even more than that, it is the SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) that is critical to today's company security.

Phishing and Malware  Among the major cyber threats, the malware remains a significant danger. The 2017 WannaCry outbreak that cost businesses worldwide up to $4 billion is still in recent memory, and other new strains of malware are discovered on a daily basis.  Phishing has also seen a resurgence in the last few years, with many new scams being invented to take advantage of unsuspecting companies. Just one variation, the CEO Fraud email scam, cost UK businesses alone £14.8m in 2018.  Working From Home  Staff working from home are outside the direct oversight of IT support teams and often struggle to deal with cyber threats and appropriately protect company information.  Failing to update software and operating systems, sending data over insecure networks, and increasing reliance on email and online messaging has made employees far more susceptible to threats ranging from malware to phishing.  Human Error  While technical solutions like spam filters and mobile device management syste

Guide: How Security Consolidation Helps Small Cybersecurity Teams<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/guide-how-security-consolidation-helps.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The dynamic nature of cybersecurity, the changes in the threat landscape, and the expansion of the attack surface lead organizations to add more security solutions—from different vendors—creating a layered security infrastructure that introduces new challenges to any team, with a much more significant impact on small ones.  And yet, sophisticated attacks continue to bypass these advanced security layers while FOMO (fear of missing out) compels security teams to evaluate every new solution that comes out.  A new guide, "How Security Consolidation Helps Small Security Teams" ( download here ), reviews the challenges of a layered, multi-vendor security approach for protecting your internal environment and reveals why the concept of consolidation of security solutions is becoming the go-to security approach of many CISOs with small teams.  Having a single consolidated solution for protecting your internal environment can free up much of your small team's time and reduce your

Security Operations is a 24 x 7 job. It does not stop for weekends or holidays or even that much-needed coffee break after the first hour of the shift is complete. We all know this.  Every SOC engineer is hoping for some rest at some point. One of my favorite jokes when talking about Security Operations is "3 SOC engineers walked into a bar…" That the joke. No SOC engineers have time to do that. They get it. They laugh. So why is this all true?  Let us explore that a little bit.   Demand for experienced SOC engineers far surpasses the available talent.  Event volume levels boggle the imagination compared to even just a few years ago.  Utilization of tools to their utmost capability has often not been a priority.&nbsp;   In the Security Operations space, we have been using SIEM's for many years with varying degrees of deployments, customization, and effectiveness. For the most part, they have been a helpful tool for Security Operations. But they can be better. Like any tool, t

New CISOs Survey Reveals How Small Cybersecurity Teams Can Confront 2021<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/new-cisos-survey-reveals-how-small.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The pressure on small to medium-sized enterprises to protect their organizations against cyberthreats is astronomical. These businesses face the same threats as the largest enterprises, experience the same (relative) damages and consequences when breaches occur as the largest enterprises but are forced to protect their organizations with a fraction of the resources as the largest enterprises.&nbsp;  Cybersecurity company Cynet just released findings from a survey of 200 CISOs in charge of small security teams ( Download here ) to shine "a spotlight into the challenges of small security teams everywhere."  In addition to better understanding the challenges these CISOs face, the 2021 Survey of CISOs with Small Security Teams delves into the strategies CISOs will employ to ensure their organizations are protected from the ongoing onslaught of cyber threats - all while saddled with limited budgets and headcount.  The survey findings will also be presented in a live webinar,&nbsp; register

With so much of the world transitioning to working, shopping, studying, and streaming online during the coronavirus pandemic, cybercriminals now have access to a larger base of potential victims than ever before.  "Zoombomb" &nbsp;became the new photobomb—hackers would gain access to a private meeting or online class hosted on Zoom and shout&nbsp; profanities and racial slurs &nbsp;or flash&nbsp; pornographic images . Nation-state hacker groups mounted attacks against organizations involved in the coronavirus pandemic response, including the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some in an attempt to politicize the pandemic.  Even garden-variety cyber attacks like email phishing, social engineering, and refund theft took on a darker flavor in response to the widespread economic precarity brought on by the pandemic.&nbsp;  "Hackers were mostly trying to take advantage of people's fear by offering medical equipment like thermometers and masks for cheap, low

In the Wake of the SolarWinds Hack, Here's How Businesses Should Respond<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/in-wake-of-solarwinds-hack-heres-how.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Throughout 2020, businesses, in general, have had their hands full with IT challenges. They had to rush to accommodate a sudden shift to remote work. Then they had to navigate a rapid adoption of automation technologies.  And as the year came to a close, more businesses began trying to assemble the safety infrastructure required to return to some semblance of normal in 2021.  But at the end of the year,&nbsp; news of a massive breach &nbsp;of IT monitoring software vendor SolarWinds introduced a new complication – the possibility of a wave of secondary data breaches and cyber-attacks. And because SolarWinds' products have a presence in so many business networks, the size of the threat is massive.  So far, though, most of the attention is getting paid to large enterprises like Microsoft and Cisco (and the US Government), who were the primary target of the SolarWinds breach. What nobody's talking about is the rest of the 18,000 or so SolarWinds clients who may have been affected. For them

Most companies with small security teams face the same issues. They have inadequate budgets, inadequate staff, and inadequate skills to face today's onslaught of sophisticated cyberthreats.  Many of these companies turn to virtual CISOs (vCISOs) to provide security expertise and guidance. vCISOs are typically former CISOs with years of experience building and managing information security programs across large and small organizations.  Autonomous XDR company Cynet, a provider of an automated breach protection platform and MDR service for even the smallest security teams, is conducting a webinar with well-known vCISO Brian Haugli to understand the common challenges faced by CISOs with small security teams [ register here ].

Enhancing Email Security with MTA-STS and SMTP TLS Reporting<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/enhancing-email-security-with-mta-sts.html"> Full Text</a>
</p>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In 1982, when SMTP was first specified, it did not contain any mechanism for providing security at the transport level to secure communications between mail transfer agents.  Later, in 1999, the STARTTLS command was added to SMTP that in turn supported the encryption of emails in between the servers, providing the ability to convert a non-secure connection into a secure one that is encrypted using TLS protocol.  However, encryption is optional in SMTP, which implies that emails can be sent in plaintext.&nbsp; Mail Transfer Agent-Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) &nbsp;is a relatively new standard that enables mail service providers the ability to enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure SMTP connections and to specify whether the sending SMTP servers should refuse to deliver emails to MX hosts that that does not offer TLS with a reliable server certificate. It has been proven to successfully mitigate TLS downgrade attacks and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.  SMTP TLS Reporting (TLS-

Pen Testing By Numbers: Tracking Pen Testing Trends and Challenges<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/pen-testing-by-numbers-tracking-pen.html"> Full Text</a>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Over the years,&nbsp; penetration testing &nbsp;has had to change and adapt alongside the IT environments and technology that need to be assessed.  Broad cybersecurity issues often influence the strategy and growth of pen-testing. In such a fast-paced field, organizations get real value from learning about others' penetration testing experiences, identifying trends, and the role they play in today's threat landscape.  While there is much to be gained from a single snapshot, additional value can come from long term data collection and year over year comparisons. We can see whether the effects that recent trends have on pen testing are long term, or simply a temporary shift, and how they affect the continuing evolution of penetration testing. For instance, 2020 saw a massive influx of remote work.  Unfortunately, the convenience of working safely from home increased the risk of a breach as countless new attack vectors opened up, both from the way employees connected to networks, as well a

End-user passwords are one of the weakest components of your overall security protocols. Most users tend to reuse passwords across work and personal accounts.  They may also choose relatively weak passwords that satisfy company password policies but can be easily guessed or brute-forced. Your users may also inadvertently use&nbsp; breached passwords &nbsp;for their corporate account password.  The&nbsp; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) &nbsp;has a cybersecurity framework that helps organizations address common cybersecurity pitfalls in their environment, including weak, reused, and breached passwords. This post will take a closer look at the NIST password guidelines and see how you can effectively audit your password policies to ensure these meet the standards recommended by NIST.  NIST Password Guidelines and Best Practices  Specific guidance around passwords is addressed within the chapter titled&nbsp; Memorized Secret Verifiers . NIST has several recommendations in regards to passwords
