On behalf of the 7-Eleven franchisees, 7-Eleven maintains a database of records for each franchise location that contains information on all franchisee employees for that location. Only the records in the database for the employees of a particular franchisee (“Employing Franchisee”) are sent to the local store and are available for access by the Employing Franchisee. 7-Eleven discovered in June 2016 that as part of the update process, in addition to the normal set of employee records sent for each Employing Franchisee, some additional records from the franchisee employee database were available to certain 7-Eleven franchisees. We immediately updated the records, investigated to determine the cause of the issue, and have taken additional safety measures to protect your information and ensure that records are not accidentally made available to any franchisee other than the Employing Franchisee.

Angelica did not learn about the inadvertent disclosure of the W-2s until April 15, 2018. Angelica immediately reached out to the former employee, who confirmed that he had deleted the message containing the W-2s. Prior to deleting the message, the former employee forwarded the attachment with all of the W-2s to his tax preparer and a current employee of Angelica, both of whom have confirmed that they deleted the file and that they did not forward the file to anyone else.

On or about November 9, 2018, we were alerted to suspicious activity regarding an employee’s business e-mail
account. We immediately began investigating this activity and subsequently determined that an unauthorized third
party had illegally gained access to the employee’s business e-mail account on July 21, 2018. The hacker also gained
access to a second employee’s email account. The hacker was able to view the contents of both e-mail accounts and
send “spear-phishing” e-mails to others. A “spear-phishing” e-mail is a message that appears to be from someone the
recipient knows and trusts, but it is actually sent by a different person trying to illegally obtain access to the recipient’s
computer system, e-mail accounts, or personal information. We have seen no evidence of this hack extending outside
of our email servers into the rest of our IT system.

Wendy’s recently reported additional malicious cyber activity involving some franchisee-operated
restaurants. The Company believes this criminal cyberattack resulted from a service provider’s remote
access credentials being compromised, allowing access – and the ability to deploy malware – to some
franchisees’ POS systems. Soon after detecting the malware, Wendy’s identified a method of disabling
it and thereafter has disabled the malware in all franchisee restaurants where it has been discovered. The
investigation has confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on
some Wendy’s franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015.

On Oct 24, 2014, we discovered that a third party obtained access to our users’ emails and
“hashed’ passwords. That means that the passwords were encrypted in such a way that it is nearly impossible
for anyone, even us, to read it. However, on Oct 24, 2017, a security researcher informed us of a file containing
emails and plaintext passwords which claims the data had come from us (Armor Games) and another company
(Coupon Mom). We are investigating whether we are the true source of the breach, since the number of leaked
emails/passwords is far less than the number of emails breached on either our system or Coupon Mom’s
system in 2013. Our users’ passwords were hashed (this makes it unlikely that they could extract plaintext
passwords from our data), and some users are reporting that their passwords were included in this breach
though they have never used either site. As we investigate the source of the data in this file, we are taking the
precautionary measure of treating this as a data breach of our own users.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Around March 21, 2013 we were notified by the credit card processing vendor that Anasazi was identified as the “common point of purchase” for a number of credit cards involved in fraudulent transactions with other merchants. The notice of common point of purchase was simply to alert Anasazi that it, perhaps with other merchants, was a merchant common to subsequent suspected fraudulent uses of payment cards used at our facility. In response to the notice, we quickly locked down our computer network and all computer systems and engaged forensic investigators, who analyzed all aspects of our data systems to determine whether credit card information was in fact accessed without authorization. The forensic experts uncovered evidence that Anasazi was the target of cyberattackers seeking to access parts of our internal network and data systems. The forensic experts found evidence that as early as June 18, 2012 the cyber-attackers installed malware apparently designed to perform certain functions, including eventually transmitting credit card data outside the secure network. While the forensic experts found no actual evidence that credit card information was in fact transmitted to the attackers, the forensic experts have concluded that the malware discovered on the Anasazi systems is consistent with that typically used to gather and transmit sensitive credit card data. Out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this notice to you even in the absence of hard evidence that your credit card data was in fact taken by the attackers.

As part of an ongoing investigation, we determined that your account was accessed without authorization in violation of AT&T’s privacy and security policies between February and July, 2014. AT&T believes your account was accessed as part of an effort to request codes that allow phones programmed for the AT&T Network to be used on other networks. This activity did not affect your AT&T mobile device(s). While there is no evidence that your Social Security Number or information related to telecommunications services that you purchase from AT&T, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information or CPNI (e.g., type of service or quantity of service), has been acquired, such information was contained in the system accessed and thus AT&T is offering you one year of free credit-monitoring. This notification to you has not been delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

Despite having implemented industry-leading cyber defense protections, a cyber attacker was able to penetrate some of our systems. We discovered the unauthorized intrusion when AECOM’s security sensors notified us of suspicious behavior on the corporate network last month; and our investigation further determined last week that the attack impacted servers that contain employee payroll databases. This intrusion may have resulted in the exposure of personal information for present and past AECOM employees, including information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and personal bank account numbers and routing information. The records at issue covered only employees who are on, or have been on, U.S. payroll.

actors accessed certain employees’ accounts without authorization between August 3, 2018 and October 20, 2018.
Unfortunately, the investigation was unable to determine which emails or attachments may have been viewed without
authorization. In an abundance of caution, the entire contents of the email accounts involved were reviewed to identify
any personal information contained within the accounts. On December 19, 2018, the programmatic and manual review
was completed, and it was determined that certain personal information was contained within the accounts that were
accessed without authorization. To date, we have no information that there has been any actual or attempted misuse of
the personal information within the accounts related to this event.

On June 21, 2018, we discovered that someone (the “attacker”) had accessed two BioMarin email mailboxes,
beginning on June 18, 2018, as a result of a successful phishing attack by which the attacker acquired a temporary
employee’s user ID and password. When we discovered the breach on June 21, we had the temporary employee
change his credentials, thereby preventing further access to the mailboxes. We have so far been unable to
determine for certain whether the attacker extracted any or all of the information in the mailboxes before this
access was terminated, but it is possible.

This incident involved email threads which were used to entice recipients to open an attachment containing malware. Malware is a term used to describe any kind of computer software with malicious intent. Recipients of these malicious emails opened the attachments, believing them to be from a credible source, which in turn installed the malware. Unfortunately, this malware is very difficult to detect, and almost none of the virus scanners available out there today are able to do so. In total, we identified 23 infected computers across our organization. Regrettably, some of your personal information may have been contained within these infected computers as many of the emails were internal and therefore deemed to be secure. If you are an entity client, this may include your authorized persons’ personal information. It is important to note that we have no evidence to support any attempts to misuse private client information thus far, but there is a possibility that your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information may have been potentially exposed to others. We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. As such, we are providing you with complimentary credit monitoring for the next two years and we ask that you enroll by following the steps outline below.

Based upon an extensive forensic investigation, it appears that unauthorized individuals installed malicious software on our payment processing systems at certain restaurant locations designed to capture payment card information. These locations included 20 in California: Bakersfield, Burlingame, Campbell, Citrus Heights, Concord, Cupertino, Daly City, Downey, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Fresno, Hayward, La Mirada, Lakewood, Montclair, Sacramento, San Marcos, Torrance and West Covina; three in Colorado: Colorado Springs, Lakewood and Greenwood Village; two in Arizona: Chandler and Peoria, and one each in Orlando, Florida, St. Louis, Missouri, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Henderson, Nevada. We believe the malware could have compromised payment card data – including name, payment card account number, card expiration date, and verification code – of customers who used a payment card at the affected locations. Although the timing of the incident varies by location, the forensic investigation has indicated that this incident may have impacted individuals who made payment card purchases between August 12, 2015 and December 4, 2015. Please visit www.elephantbar.com/incident for a list of the affected locations, the specific time frame for each location during which we believe payment card data could have been affected, and some other helpful resources.

While this matter is still under investigation, we wish to report what we currently know. In early
March of 2016, we received notice from several of our restaurant locations that their Point of
Sale (POS) systems were not working properly. Our POS Vendor began an investigation to
assess the problem and initiated heightened security measures. When the POS Vendor found
malware on the POS software at some Cicis restaurants, we immediately began a restaurant by
restaurant data security review and remediation. We also retained a third party cyber security
firm to perform a forensic analysis to determine what, if any, information might have been
compromised and to verify that all threats have been eliminated. The forensic firm reported its
findings on July 19, 2016 confirming that a malicious software program had been introduced by
a hacker to the POS system used by some Cicis restaurant locations. The threat of that malware
to our restaurants has been eliminated

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Choice recently learned of a technical issue that only occurred in a specific circumstance. The cause of
the issue has been addressed. The issue involved information entered by a visitor to Choice’s website
being inadvertently accessible to third parties, with whom Choice has a business relationship, when the
visitor’s web browser crashed while on the site. Choice uses technology to track activities that occur on
its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to Choice.
For visitors to Choice’s website who used the Safari web browser, if Safari crashed and restarted, Safari
would put information that had been typed by the visitor on the page into the website address for that
page. Tracking technology reads the website address of pages on Choice’s website and sends the data
to third parties. Except in a Safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information
entered by visitors. We believe this occurred because of how the code for Safari was written. This
specific issue occurred approximately 88,000 times from June 2015 through November 12, 2019.

from our third party e-commerce partner. We immediately began to investigate these reports to
identify what happened and what information was impacted. Third-party computer forensic
investigators were retained to assist with the investigation into what happened and what data was

Between March 31, 2020 and April 1, 2020, four (4) electronically filed tax returns were rejected by the Intuit Lacerte tax preparation software, which Lacerte reported was due to the fact that returns were previously filed for those taxpayers.  We immediately reported this incident to the IRS, Secret Service, Fresno Police and FBI, and, working with Lacerte, identified a total of 30 fraudulent returns. You are not among the individuals identified on the 30 fraudulent returns.  We also immediately retained forensic investigators to conduct an investigation, and, to date, we have found no evidence that any unauthorized individual has accessed our computer systems, where your personal information is stored.

Decron became aware of unusual activity in certain Decron email accounts. In
response, Decron worked with an outside forensics expert to investigate the nature and scope of the

without authorization on April 28, 2019. Although the investigation was unable to determine whether
any information contained in email messages or file attachments stored in the email accounts was
actually accessed by an unauthorized actor, we cannot rule out whether that type of activity occurred.
