confirmed which of the attempts resulted in a login to online accounts. You are

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For most hotels, there are two ways to make a reservation – directly with the hotel or indirectly through
third-party online booking websites (websites run by other companies that compare rooms and rates at
different hotels). For reservations that are made through online booking websites, many hotels use a
technology service provider to collect the reservation data from the online booking company and enter it
into the hotel’s property management system. On March 26, 2019, we were notified by the company that
provides that service to us and other hotel companies that it was conducting an investigation to determine
if there had been unauthorized access to its network. The service provider reported that it had hired a
cybersecurity firm to conduct an investigation. Since then Drury Hotels has worked closely with the service
provider to get updates on its investigation.

investigation and, with the help of a third-party forensic provider, later determined that some employees’ email

After we received a report suggesting that there may have been unauthorized access to data from payment
cards that were legitimately used at certain Arcis Golf locations, the Company immediately launched an
investigation and engaged a leading computer security firm to assist. On January 16, 2019, findings from the
investigation identified the operation of malware designed to access payment card data from cards used on
point-of-sale (POS) devices at certain Arcis Golf locations. It is possible that data from cards used at the
locations involved may have been accessed between August 15, 2018 and February 4, 2019.

On April 29, 2018, at approximately 4:00 p.m. (all times PST), we learned that there was
unauthorized access by electronic means to our data by a person or persons whose identities remain
unknown. The unauthorized access occurred sometime between 1:00 p.m., on April 26, 2018, and 3:08 p.m.,
on that same date. The unauthorized access involved the insertion of rogue code into our checkout page.
The code was designed to capture the name, billing address, phone number, and email address of certain
customers, and also their credit card information, and then send that data to a remote endpoint. The customer
order dates for potentially compromised information are April 26, 2018, at 1:00 p.m., until April 29, 2018, at
4:10 p.m. Although we cannot be sure that any of your information was accessed or misappropriated, we are
sending you this notice to make you aware of the situation and to provide you with other helpful information.

On September 23, 2020, GGRC detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity’s network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity’s files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity’s files. Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. Based on preliminary findings of the computer forensics firm, it was determined on October 5, 2020, that certain information belonging to the individuals we serve was acquired by an unknown actor.

On September 21, 2017, our system monitoring tools identified unusual activity relating
to a database within our network that is tied to a web application used by customers. We disabled the web
application and immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of this activity.
A leading third-party forensic investigation firm was retained to assist with our own internal investigation.
Although the investigation is ongoing, we determined on October 6, 2017 that there was evidence a small
amount of data left our system between June 18, 2017 and September 19, 2017. As we cannot determine
the contents of this data, we cannot rule out that this data included personal information relating to [Data

during this time frame, we undertook a comprehensive review of all of the emails that were present in the relevant

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In January 2019, Inmediata became aware that some of its member patients’ electronic patient health information was
publicly available online as a result of a webpage setting that permitted search engines to index pages that are part
of an internal website we use for our business operations. When we became aware of the incident, we immediately
deactivated the website and engaged an independent computer forensics firm to assist us. Based on the investigation,
we have no evidence that any files were copied or saved. In addition, we have not discovered any evidence that any
information that may be involved in this incident has been misused. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are
informing you about the incident and providing you with information and resources to assist you.

On November 26, 2018, we observed newly encrypted files within our server environment. Upon discovery of the
encrypted files, we immediately engaged a leading cybersecurity forensic investigation firm to assist with decrypting
our files, which proved successful when the forensic firm deployed a decryption utility. The forensic firm then
investigated the nature and scope of this incident.
