Whiting-Turner uses an outside vendor to provide tax filing and information services, including
preparation of our employees’ W-2 and 1095 tax forms. On March 8, 2016, this vendor notified us they had detected
suspicious activity on their systems. We also received reports around that time from some of our employees regarding
fraudulent tax filings in their names. In response, we immediately shut down the ability for users to access the
information on the outside vendor’s systems and began an investigation to determine whether any Whiting-Turner
employee information was accessed by an unauthorized individual. Our investigation is ongoing, and we have not yet
confirmed whether any Whiting-Turner information was subject to unauthorized access on the outside vendor’s systems.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Neiman Marcus has detected that, in January 2016, unauthorized individuals began attempting to try various login and
password combinations using automated attacks on our mobile app environment. We suspect this activity was due to large
breaches at other companies (not associated with Neiman Marcus), in which user login names and passwords were stolen.
Once the unauthorized individuals were able to access the mobile app environment, the intruders were able to access
customer names, address information, phone numbers, the last four digits of the customer’s credit card number, credit card
expiration date, and gift card information, including account number. They were not able to view full credit card numbers.
Unfortunately, your mobile app account was one of the accounts accessed by these unauthorized individuals.

Roll engaged HUB to provide risk management services related to its workers’ compensation insurance program. On

car. HUB immediately began to investigate and recreate any unencrypted information that might have been accessible
from the laptop’s hard drive. Through this process, we were able to ascertain by March 12, that the laptop contained data
that included your name and certain information that is commonly needed to assess workers’ compensation premiums
and claims (e.g., the date on which you made a workers’ compensation claim, the claim number, brief accident and
injury descriptions and compensation amounts related to the claim). We are in the process of taking steps to reduce the
likelihood of such an event occurring again. Unfortunately, your social security number does appear to have been included
in the data associated with your claim information.

On January 15, 2013, we discovered potential fraudulent access to our system. The individual accessed
a limited set of information which may have included information about you, including your name,
Social Security number and/or driver’s license number, through what we now believe was a fraudulent
account. There was limited access to information beginning in August of 2012, with the majority of access
through this account occurring in January, 2013. Upon discovering the fraudulent access, we immediately
terminated access and we worked with law enforcement to identify and locate the individual. Law
enforcement asked that we delay our notification to you so as not to interfere with their investigation.
The individual has been arrested and his operation has been shut down. To date, no misuse of information
has been reported to us or, to our knowledge, law enforcement. Law enforcement has lifted its hold

This cyber-attack involved the unauthorized access of an email account of an individual associated with <<company 1>>. We became aware of this incident on September 23, 2020 when we were notified that an unauthorized entity successfully sent several spam emails from the affected email account to various email addresses unfamiliar to the account holder. Since this unauthorized entity had access to the account holder’s mailbox, it is possible that data contained within the mailbox may have been acquired and disclosed to others. Upon becoming aware of this incident, we took immediate action to secure the account and investigate the incident. As a result of the investigation, we determined that there was unauthorized access to the email account from September 17, 2020 to September 23, 2020, when the account was locked. The affected email account contained information about some of the individuals with whom we have a business relationship, including you.

We began an internal investigation, and a leading computer forensic firm was hired to assist. The investigation determined that an unauthorized person gained access to the Gmail accounts between May 24, 2019 and November 6, 2019, and again between November 11, 2019 and January 8, 2020. The investigation was unable to determine whether the unauthorized person actually viewed any emails or attachments in the accounts.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We care about the security of your personal information, and we are writing to tell you that we have discovered evidence of unauthorized access to some of your personal information. On October 9, 2020, we were alerted to unusual activity involving our website, thenorthface.com, that prompted us to investigate immediately. Following a careful investigation, we concluded that a credential stuffing attack had been launched against our website on October 8 and 9, 2020. A “credential stuffing attack” is a specific type of cybersecurity attack in which the attacker uses account authentication credentials (e.g., email addresses/usernames and passwords) stolen from another source, such as a breach of another company or website, to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Credential stuffing attacks can occur when individuals use the same authentication credentials on multiple websites, which is why we encourage you to use a unique password on thenorthface.com.<br><br>  

Based on our investigation, we believe that the attacker previously gained access to your email address and password from another source (not from The North Face) and subsequently used those same credentials to access your account on thenorthface.com.<br><br>  

We do not believe that the attacker obtained information from us that would require us to notify you of a data security breach under applicable law, but we are notifying you of the incident voluntarily, out of an abundance of caution.<br><br>

In May 2020, Blackbaud experienced a ransomware incident that impacted certain systems within the Blackbaud environment. As a result of this incident, certain Blackbaud systems were encrypted and a Blackbaud database backup file including VSAC data was removed from the Blackbaud environment by an unauthorized actor. While Blackbaud’s investigation was able to determine that the backup file was removed between February 7, 2020 and May 20, 2020, their investigation was unable to confirm exactly when this occurred. As a result, the unauthorized actor may have had access to certain information contained within the backup database. Upon learning of this incident, VSAC immediately began an investigation to determine the full nature and scope of the event and what, if any, VSAC data may have been impacted. On or about August 7, 2020, VSAC’s investigation determined that the backup database may have contained personal information.

On June 4, 2020, Verigent learned that the email accounts accessed without authorization contained some of your personal information which may have been viewed by an unauthorized individual. Verigent then worked diligently to identify up-to-date address information in order to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals.

On or around September 20, 2017, WEI Mortgage LLC (“WEI Mortgage”) received
reports of unusual activity in an employee’s email account. We immediately began an investigation to
confirm the security of our network and to determine the nature and scope of this event. With the
assistance of third-party forensic investigators, we learned our company was the victim of an email
phishing attack, resulting in unauthorized access to certain employee email accounts. Based upon
available forensic evidence, it appears these email accounts were subject to unauthorized access between
September 13 and September 28, 2017. While we have no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of
personal information, the investigation revealed some personal information was present in the impacted
email accounts at the time of the incident.

To process its payment card transactions on its websites (westmusic.com and percussionsource.com), West Music
uses a digital commerce platform provided and maintained by a third party vendor named Aptos. On February 6,
2017, we learned from Aptos that it discovered unauthorized access into the portion of the Aptos system containing
payment card information for various Aptos customers, including some West Music customers. Upon learning of
the unauthorized access, Aptos contacted the FBI Cyber Division and the U.S. Department of Justice and engaged
a cybersecurity firm to help contain and eliminate the issue. While investigating, law enforcement requested that
Aptos defer disclosing and discussing the matter with potentially affected retailers (like West Music) and customers
(you) until February 5, 2017 given the active investigation. The investigation determined that malware injected
into the Aptos system may have allowed unauthorized access to certain customer and payment card information
maintained by Aptos. The unauthorized access occurred between February 2016 and December 2016. Based on the
investigation, Aptos informed us that payment card transactions that were made on www.westmusic.com and www.
percussionsource.com were affected by the incident, including both historical card transactions and transactions
made during the period of unauthorized access. This may have affected a transaction you made using a card ending
in <<last four numbers of card>>.

Zero Water (“Zero”) recently received a report of unusual card activity from its credit card processor.
Upon receiving these reports, Zero worked with a third-party forensic investigator, and our website provider to identify
the source of the activity and to confirm the security of our network. The investigation determined that a vulnerability
existed on our website that would permit access to certain customer payment card information if the vulnerability was
exploited. On or around May 24, 2019 we determined that there was evidence that the vulnerability was exploited
and that there was unauthorized access to obfuscated payment card information used at www.zerowater.com.

Zurich works with a vendor to collect the payment information required to process electronic claim-related
payments.  Recently, Zurich learned that falsified account information was submitted through the vendor system
in order to gain unauthorized access to certain claim payments between August – December 2018.  Because the
Explanation of Benefits (EOB) related to your insurance claim was included with the claim payment, there was
unauthorized access to your personal information.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As you know, Zocdoc allows you to book appointments with doctors who list their medical or dental
practices on our service. Each practice registered with Zocdoc receives usernames which allow staff
members to access Zocdoc’s system (the “Provider Dashboard”) to view appointments and other
information you provide when you book an appointment. In June 2015, we learned of programming errors
in the processes responsible for managing username access to the Provider Dashboard. This allowed some
past or current practice staff members to access the Provider Dashboard, and therefore potentially view
your personal information, after their usernames were removed, deleted or otherwise limited. Access may
have occurred between [first access date] to [last access date]. These practices and their staff members
had obligations regarding the secure and confidential handling of personal information.
