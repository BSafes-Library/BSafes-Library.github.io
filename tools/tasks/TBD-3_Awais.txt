they got out of bed at 3:30 am and hit the ground running), and investigated and
confirmed which of the attempts resulted in a login to online accounts. You are

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
For most hotels, there are two ways to make a reservation – directly with the hotel or indirectly through
third-party online booking websites (websites run by other companies that compare rooms and rates at
different hotels). For reservations that are made through online booking websites, many hotels use a
technology service provider to collect the reservation data from the online booking company and enter it
into the hotel’s property management system. On March 26, 2019, we were notified by the company that
provides that service to us and other hotel companies that it was conducting an investigation to determine
if there had been unauthorized access to its network. The service provider reported that it had hired a
cybersecurity firm to conduct an investigation. Since then Drury Hotels has worked closely with the service
provider to get updates on its investigation.

investigation and, with the help of a third-party forensic provider, later determined that some employees’ email

investigator then reviewed the contents of these email accounts to determine whether they contained any
sensitive personal information. On December 18, 2017, we confirmed that sensitive information was located in
one or more of the email accounts. On January 17, 2018, the forensic investigator completed the review of the
affected email accounts and provided Driscoll’s with a list of employees whose protected information was
contained within the email accounts. The unauthorized access may have occurred between July 17, 2017 and

did not provide the Dropbox credentials to any other individual. DFCU determined on November 23, 2016, that the files
transferred to the employee’s Dropbox account included personal information of all DFCU members.

Blackbaud notified us that it discovered a ransomware attack on its systems around May 20, 2020. Blackbaud retained independent forensics experts and notified law enforcement. Shortly after the discovery, Blackbaud expelled the cybercriminal from its system.  However, Blackbaud determined that before being locked out the cybercriminal had removed a copy of the Foundation’s backup file maintained on Blackbaud’s servers, which contained your personal information. Blackbaud believes the cybercriminal accessed this file initially on February 7, 2020 and retained access until May 20, 2020. We understand that Blackbaud confirmed that the backup file copy had been destroyed. Based on the nature of the incident, Blackbaud’s research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigations, Blackbaud does not believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was misused, or will be further disseminated.

After experiencing unusual activity during this filing season with an escalated number of rejected returns and a
few clients receiving letters from the IRS telling them that someone had filed or attempted to file a 2016 tax return that we
had not prepared, we immediately hired IT consultants to investigate. On March 13, 2017, a specialized forensic IT firm
determined that hackers had gained unauthorized access to our system from a foreign IP address. After a thorough
investigation we have discovered that the unauthorized access occurred on April 1-2, 2016, and occurred through Remote
Desktop Protocol between September 28, 2016 and November 3, 2016.

On September 23, 2020, GGRC detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity’s network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity’s files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity’s files. Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. Based on preliminary findings of the computer forensics firm, it was determined on October 5, 2020, that certain information belonging to the individuals we serve was acquired by an unknown actor.

On June 15, 2018, Gordon Schanzlin became aware of a U.S. Postal Inspection Service raid of
a house in the Southern California area that occurred on June 14, 2018. As a result of the raid, a box containing
medical records related to certain Gordon Schanzlin clients was recovered from the occupants of the house. After
learning of this incident, Gordon Schanzlin launched an internal investigation to determine the nature and scope
of this event and to ascertain who may be impacted by this incident. Though the investigation into this incident is
still ongoing, Gordon Schanzlin believes the incident may be related to unauthorized entry in October 2017 into a
storage unit where your information was located. Gordon Schanzlin is fully cooperating with law enforcement as
their investigation continues.

For the first time in our history, during the week of October 23, 2017, we received indication that one of
our computers was improperly accessed as the result of an email phishing scam. We immediately began
an investigation and hired a computer forensic specialist to assist us. The investigation revealed that an
unauthorized third party accessed one of our email accounts. The unauthorized third party created an
email folder and attempted to direct emails relating to "wire transfers" to the account. We have no
evidence to suggest that any emails in the account were copied or transferred. We then retained counsel
experienced in data breach to assist us with complying with regulatory requirements. Despite having no
indication that individual emails were accessed, we were advised that we needed to undertake a
comprehensive review of all of the information contained in the email account to ascertain if any personal
information could have been accessed.

In late December 2018, we became aware of unusual activity relating to certain employee email
accounts. We quickly began an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the activity. Working with computer
forensic investigators, on January 3, 2019, we determined that certain employee email accounts were subject to
unauthorized access. Our investigation ultimately confirmed this unauthorized access occurred between October 25,
2018 and November 30, 2018. Because the forensic investigation could not rule out access to emails in the account
during this time frame, we undertook a comprehensive review of all of the emails that were present in the relevant
accounts at the time of the incident to identify what information was stored within the emails. Although we are unaware of
any actual or attempted misuse of your personal information, we are providing you this notification out of an abundance

As soon as we became aware of a potential issue, we quickly engaged leading data security
experts to conduct an investigation. We also have been working with law enforcement authorities
and coordinating with the payment card companies. Based on the investigation to date, we
understand that, around July 1, 2017, malware began running on certain point of sale systems at
potentially all Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks OFF 5TH and Lord & Taylor locations in North
America. We have contained the issue and believe it no longer poses a risk to customers
shopping at our stores. Not all customers who shopped at the potentially impacted stores during
the relevant time period are affected by this issue. We want to reassure affected customers that
they will not be liable for fraudulent charges that may result from this matter.

On August 6, 2020, ICCD became aware of a potential compromise on our computer network. Upon discovery, ICCD swiftly engaged a third-party forensic company to investigate and we dedicated all of our IT and engineering resources to resolve the problem. Following progress by experts in their thorough investigation, it was ultimately determined that, on August 5, 2020, the administrative account of one employee was hacked and compromised by an unknown source, which allowed unauthorized access onto ICCD’s computer network. Upon confirmation of this unauthorized access, ICCD’s third-party forensic experts immediately investigated whether the affected databases contained individuals’ sensitive information. On October 16, 2020, after a thorough investigation, ICCD learned that the unauthorized access may have enabled access to individuals’ personal information. We diligently began reviewing the list to identify any records that contained information that was considered personally identifiable information (“PII”) under state and federal laws and to obtain sufficient contact information to provide you with this notification
