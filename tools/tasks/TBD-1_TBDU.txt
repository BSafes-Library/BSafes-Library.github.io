On behalf of the 7-Eleven franchisees, 7-Eleven maintains a database of records for each franchise location that contains information on all franchisee employees for that location. Only the records in the database for the employees of a particular franchisee (“Employing Franchisee”) are sent to the local store and are available for access by the Employing Franchisee. 7-Eleven discovered in June 2016 that as part of the update process, in addition to the normal set of employee records sent for each Employing Franchisee, some additional records from the franchisee employee database were available to certain 7-Eleven franchisees. We immediately updated the records, investigated to determine the cause of the issue, and have taken additional safety measures to protect your information and ensure that records are not accidentally made available to any franchisee other than the Employing Franchisee.

Angelica did not learn about the inadvertent disclosure of the W-2s until April 15, 2018. Angelica immediately reached out to the former employee, who confirmed that he had deleted the message containing the W-2s. Prior to deleting the message, the former employee forwarded the attachment with all of the W-2s to his tax preparer and a current employee of Angelica, both of whom have confirmed that they deleted the file and that they did not forward the file to anyone else.

On or about November 9, 2018, we were alerted to suspicious activity regarding an employee’s business e-mail
account. We immediately began investigating this activity and subsequently determined that an unauthorized third
party had illegally gained access to the employee’s business e-mail account on July 21, 2018. The hacker also gained
access to a second employee’s email account. The hacker was able to view the contents of both e-mail accounts and
send “spear-phishing” e-mails to others. A “spear-phishing” e-mail is a message that appears to be from someone the
recipient knows and trusts, but it is actually sent by a different person trying to illegally obtain access to the recipient’s
computer system, e-mail accounts, or personal information. We have seen no evidence of this hack extending outside
of our email servers into the rest of our IT system.

Wendy’s recently reported additional malicious cyber activity involving some franchisee-operated
restaurants. The Company believes this criminal cyberattack resulted from a service provider’s remote
access credentials being compromised, allowing access – and the ability to deploy malware – to some
franchisees’ POS systems. Soon after detecting the malware, Wendy’s identified a method of disabling
it and thereafter has disabled the malware in all franchisee restaurants where it has been discovered. The
investigation has confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on
some Wendy’s franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015.

On Oct 24, 2014, we discovered that a third party obtained access to our users’ emails and
“hashed’ passwords. That means that the passwords were encrypted in such a way that it is nearly impossible
for anyone, even us, to read it. However, on Oct 24, 2017, a security researcher informed us of a file containing
emails and plaintext passwords which claims the data had come from us (Armor Games) and another company
(Coupon Mom). We are investigating whether we are the true source of the breach, since the number of leaked
emails/passwords is far less than the number of emails breached on either our system or Coupon Mom’s
system in 2013. Our users’ passwords were hashed (this makes it unlikely that they could extract plaintext
passwords from our data), and some users are reporting that their passwords were included in this breach
though they have never used either site. As we investigate the source of the data in this file, we are taking the
precautionary measure of treating this as a data breach of our own users.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Around March 21, 2013 we were notified by the credit card processing vendor that Anasazi was identified as the “common point of purchase” for a number of credit cards involved in fraudulent transactions with other merchants. The notice of common point of purchase was simply to alert Anasazi that it, perhaps with other merchants, was a merchant common to subsequent suspected fraudulent uses of payment cards used at our facility. In response to the notice, we quickly locked down our computer network and all computer systems and engaged forensic investigators, who analyzed all aspects of our data systems to determine whether credit card information was in fact accessed without authorization. The forensic experts uncovered evidence that Anasazi was the target of cyberattackers seeking to access parts of our internal network and data systems. The forensic experts found evidence that as early as June 18, 2012 the cyber-attackers installed malware apparently designed to perform certain functions, including eventually transmitting credit card data outside the secure network. While the forensic experts found no actual evidence that credit card information was in fact transmitted to the attackers, the forensic experts have concluded that the malware discovered on the Anasazi systems is consistent with that typically used to gather and transmit sensitive credit card data. Out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this notice to you even in the absence of hard evidence that your credit card data was in fact taken by the attackers.

As part of an ongoing investigation, we determined that your account was accessed without authorization in violation of AT&T’s privacy and security policies between February and July, 2014. AT&T believes your account was accessed as part of an effort to request codes that allow phones programmed for the AT&T Network to be used on other networks. This activity did not affect your AT&T mobile device(s). While there is no evidence that your Social Security Number or information related to telecommunications services that you purchase from AT&T, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information or CPNI (e.g., type of service or quantity of service), has been acquired, such information was contained in the system accessed and thus AT&T is offering you one year of free credit-monitoring. This notification to you has not been delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

Despite having implemented industry-leading cyber defense protections, a cyber attacker was able to penetrate some of our systems. We discovered the unauthorized intrusion when AECOM’s security sensors notified us of suspicious behavior on the corporate network last month; and our investigation further determined last week that the attack impacted servers that contain employee payroll databases. This intrusion may have resulted in the exposure of personal information for present and past AECOM employees, including information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and personal bank account numbers and routing information. The records at issue covered only employees who are on, or have been on, U.S. payroll.

actors accessed certain employees’ accounts without authorization between August 3, 2018 and October 20, 2018.
Unfortunately, the investigation was unable to determine which emails or attachments may have been viewed without
authorization. In an abundance of caution, the entire contents of the email accounts involved were reviewed to identify
any personal information contained within the accounts. On December 19, 2018, the programmatic and manual review
was completed, and it was determined that certain personal information was contained within the accounts that were
accessed without authorization. To date, we have no information that there has been any actual or attempted misuse of
the personal information within the accounts related to this event.

On June 21, 2018, we discovered that someone (the “attacker”) had accessed two BioMarin email mailboxes,
beginning on June 18, 2018, as a result of a successful phishing attack by which the attacker acquired a temporary
employee’s user ID and password. When we discovered the breach on June 21, we had the temporary employee
change his credentials, thereby preventing further access to the mailboxes. We have so far been unable to
determine for certain whether the attacker extracted any or all of the information in the mailboxes before this
access was terminated, but it is possible.
