We are contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred on August 25, 2020 at Cantella & Co., Inc. This incident involved email threads which were used to entice recipients to open an attachment containing malware. Malware is a term used to describe any kind of computer software with malicious intent. Recipients of these malicious emails opened the attachments, believing them to be from a credible source, which in turn installed the malware. Unfortunately, this malware is very difficult to detect, and almost none of the virus scanners available out there today are able to do so. In total, we identified 23 infected computers across our organization. Regrettably, some of your personal information may have been contained within these infected computers as many of the emails were internal and therefore deemed to be secure. If you are an entity client, this may include your authorized persons’ personal information. It is important to note that we have no evidence to support any attempts to misuse private client information thus far, but there is a possibility that your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information may have been potentially exposed to others. We value your business and respect the privacy of your information.

 On March 6, 2019, the FBI informed Citrix that the FBI had reason to believe that international
cyber criminals gained access to Citrix’s internal network. Following receipt of this information, we immediately
launched an investigation, which remains ongoing. We currently believe that the cyber criminals had intermittent access
to our network between October 13, 2018 and March 8, 2019 and that they removed files from our systems, which may
have included files containing information about our current and former employees and, in limited cases, information
about beneficiaries and/or dependents. Out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this letter to current and former
employees of Citrix to alert them of this incident. We will notify you if your beneficiaries or dependents were impacted.

On November 3, 2015, Elephant Bar was alerted to a potential security incident by its card processor. Based upon an extensive forensic investigation, it appears that unauthorized individuals installed malicious software on our payment processing systems at certain restaurant locations designed to capture payment card information. These locations included 20 in California: Bakersfield, Burlingame, Campbell, Citrus Heights, Concord, Cupertino, Daly City, Downey, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Fresno, Hayward, La Mirada, Lakewood, Montclair, Sacramento, San Marcos, Torrance and West Covina; three in Colorado: Colorado Springs, Lakewood and Greenwood Village; two in Arizona: Chandler and Peoria, and one each in Orlando, Florida, St. Louis, Missouri, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Henderson, Nevada. We believe the malware could have compromised payment card data – including name, payment card account number, card expiration date, and verification code – of customers who used a payment card at the affected locations. Although the timing of the incident varies by location, the forensic investigation has indicated that this incident may have impacted individuals who made payment card purchases between August 12, 2015 and December 4, 2015. Please visit www.elephantbar.com/incident for a list of the affected locations, the specific time frame for each location during which we believe payment card data could have been affected, and some other helpful resources.

Choice recently learned of a technical issue that only occurred in a specific circumstance. The cause of
the issue has been addressed. The issue involved information entered by a visitor to Choice’s website
being inadvertently accessible to third parties, with whom Choice has a business relationship, when the
visitor’s web browser crashed while on the site. Choice uses technology to track activities that occur on
its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to Choice.
For visitors to Choice’s website who used the Safari web browser, if Safari crashed and restarted, Safari
would put information that had been typed by the visitor on the page into the website address for that
page. Tracking technology reads the website address of pages on Choice’s website and sends the data
to third parties. Except in a Safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information
entered by visitors. We believe this occurred because of how the code for Safari was written. This
specific issue occurred approximately 88,000 times from June 2015 through November 12, 2019.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As a result of a breach at a former third-party service provider, an unauthorized party illegally accessed and stole certain customer data at Dave between June 23 and July 1, 2020. As soon as we became aware of this incident on July 1, 2020, our security team quickly took steps to secure our systems including our customers’ accounts. We immediately began an investigation, retained a leading cybersecurity firm, and notified law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”).<br><br>

After the compromise at Dave’s service provider, the unauthorized party was able to gain temporary access to Dave’s systems and obtained certain Dave customer data. It appears this data is now posted online as available for sale on, or download from, illicit online marketplaces, which the FBI is aware of and is investigating. You are receiving this notice because we determined that your records are among those that may have been impacted.
