computers containing tax software for my personal tax clients. That software contained personal tax
information including the Social Security numbers and birthdates for all of the persons listed on your tax return
(spouse and dependents). If you ever provided me bank accounts used for Direct Deposit, then you should alert
your banking institution for that particular account and follow their advice. One of the laptops possibly
included tax years as far back as 2010. I have no evidence that the laptops were targeted or that the information
stored on the laptops at the time they were stolen was accessed or acquired by an unauthorized individual.

personnel, to access our tax filing software around that time. This allowed the cybercriminals to access our system
and files, including the use of what appears to be one staff’s credentials.

Capital Forensics is a firm that provides consulting and data analysis to assist firms with regulatory,
compliance, and risk management activities. On November 1, 2018, Capital Forensics notified LPL that,
on the same day, an unauthorized person appears to have gained access to a single Capital Forensics
user’s account on a third party file-sharing system it uses to share data with customers, including LPL.
Capital Forensics reported that it promptly secured the Capital Forensics user’s account that same day
but that files containing LPL client information were among the data potentially accessed. Upon
learning this, we immediately launched an investigation and coordinated with Capital Forensics to
ensure that the LPL data, including client information, was removed from that file-sharing system.

Loungefly appears to have experienced an incident in which unauthorized code was placed
on the portion of our computer network that processes payment card transactions for the Loungefly online store
at www.loungefly.com. In response, we took immediate steps to secure the affected part of our network,
including removing the unauthorized code. Following the discovery of the code, an investigation also was
commenced to understand the nature and scope of the incident. The investigation concluded on April 3, 2019.
At this time, we believe that we will not ever be able to confirm that any payment card information was in fact
acquired by an unauthorized individual as a result of the incident. However, we also cannot rule out the
possibility that data associated with less than 3,600 payment cards used in transactions between September 19
and December 17, 2018 may have been affected. We have reported the matter to law enforcement, but this
notice has not been delayed because of law enforcement investigation.

The Cybercrime industry represents an over trillion-dollar industry that is ever-changing and growing all the time—a threat to all companies around the world. At Blackbaud, our Cyber Security team successfully defends against millions of attacks each month and is constantly studying the landscape to ensure we are able to stay ahead of this sophisticated criminal industry. In May of 2020, we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. In a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. After discovering the attempted attack, our Cyber Security team—together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement—successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from our system.

Through these investigations, PaperlessPay confirmed that an unknown person (the “Hacker”)
on February 18, 2020accessed PaperlessPay’s database where MMC employees’ data was
stored. The available evidence has not, however, allowed DHS, the FBI, or Ankura to
determine what data the Hacker may have accessed or viewed while connected to the database.
It is possible the Hacker only used access to determine the size of the database and to stage it
for subsequent access that could be sold to others, and that the Hacker did not directly access
any employee data. The security system also has an alert system that is configured to detect
data file transfers that exceed 1GB in size, and no alert was triggered during this security
incident event. However, the Hacker would have had the capability to run queries against the
database and view its data, so we cannot rule out the possibility of unauthorized access or
acquisition.

designed to copy payment card data from cards used in person was installed in certain corporate and
franchised restaurants at different times over the general period of April 29, 2019 to July 22, 2019. The
unauthorized code was not present at all locations, and at most locations it was present for only a few
weeks in July. A list of the Moe’s Southwest Grill locations involved and the respective time frames, which
vary by location, is available here.

On Friday, February 15, 2019, while trying to resolve an email failure with our email host, Suddenlink, I was
directed to a website that gave a phone number to call for immediate assistance. When I called this number, the
technician stated he could certainly help. He requested access to my computer to understand the issue with the
email. After I installed the software necessary to give him remote access to my computer, he pulled up some IP
addresses on my computer screen and stated that this was the reason for the email failure. He then insisted that in
order to fix the problem and prevent viruses from attacking, I would need to allow him to install a program on our
office’s network server. I told him no and that our local computer technician would be contacted to deal with this.
At that point, he stated that only a Microsoft Tech such as himself would be able to do this. This was a red flag as I
thought I was dealing with a Suddenlink technician. At that point, I quickly disconnected my computer from the
internet and from our office network. I then uninstalled the remote access software I had just allowed him to install,
and turned the computer off. This entire interaction lasted less than eight minutes.

current and former employees. We discovered the inadvertent disclosure on March 3rd and we
immediately began investigating what happened. We also began to address this matter with the
appropriate authorities. Please know that this information was stolen through a sophisticated phishing
scam for employee information and did not involve any customer information or an intrusion into our
computer systems or network. This disclosure was the result of an incredibly unfortunate human error.

In 2016, Morgan Stanley closed two data centers and decommissioned the computer equipment in both locations. As is
customary, we contracted with a vendor to remove the data from the devices. We subsequently learned that certain devices
believed to have been wiped of all information still contained some unencrypted data. Separately, in 2019, Morgan Stanley
disconnected and replaced a computer server in a local branch office. That server had stored information on encrypted disks
that may have included personal information. During a recent inventory, we were unable to locate that device. The
manufacturer subsequently informed us of a software flaw that could have resulted in small amounts of previously deleted
data remaining on the disks in unencrypted form. We have worked with outside technical experts to understand the facts
and any potential risks.

On April 27, 2020, an unauthorized individual obtained access to the email account of an NCP employee. NCP became aware of the unauthorized access on May 19, 2020 and took immediate steps to contain the incident. We terminated the unauthorized access to the email account the same day it was discovered and worked with a leading cybersecurity forensics firm to investigate this matter. As part of our investigation, NCP conducted an extensive review of the employee’s email account to determine if any emails contained personal information. Unfortunately, on or around June 18, 2020, we identified information about you within the employee’s mailbox. All available evidence suggests that the unauthorized individual’s purpose was to attempt to commit financial fraud against NCP—not to seek and obtain any personal information about the Clinic’s patients. Importantly, there is no evidence that the unauthorized person actually viewed any emails containing your information.

On July 24, 2019, we discovered that the login point for users on the Niche.com
website was subject to an automated attack. The attack attempted to gain
access to Niche user accounts using username and password pairs from
externally available sources. While our investigation found no evidence that
user account information was compromised or changed, there were successful
logins detected for certain Niche users from a source believed to be a part of
the attack. We promptly investigated the scope of the attack and disabled
potentially compromised passwords. Though we did not find any evidence that
any account information was collected from the users following the
unauthorized login, we locked user accounts and prompted users to reset
passwords out of an abundance of caution.

On May 6, 2019, Northwood became aware of suspicious activity relating to an employee email
account, as a result of a phishing email that captured the employee’s login credentials. We immediately launched an
investigation to determine what may have happened and what information may have been affected. Working together
with a leading computer forensics expert, our investigation determined that an unauthorized individual accessed the
email account between May 3 and May 6, 2019. Because we were unable to determine which email messages in the
account may have been accessed or viewed by the unauthorized individual, we reviewed the entire contents of the email
account to identify what personal and protected information was stored within it. On June 19, 2019, we identified the
individuals potentially impacted by this incident after a thorough review of the email account. No other email accounts or
Northwood systems were impacted by this incident.

Earlier this year NARS discovered suspicious emails being sent from an employee’s email
account. NARS quickly launched an investigation, with the assistance of a third party forensic investigator, to
understand the nature and scope of the event, and whether any sensitive data was at risk. The forensic investigation
confirmed that just a few employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized access from February 7, 2018 until
March 27, 2018 some of which were accessible for much less time. The forensic investigator then reviewed the email
accounts to determine if they contained any personal information. On June 27, 2018, NARS determined the affected
email accounts contained information relating to you. Unfortunately, the forensic investigator was only able to locate
a small percentage of the addresses for the individuals and entities whose information was stored within these emails.
NARS then undertook an extensive search of its internal records and a third-party vendor was retained to locate the
missing addresses. Once these addresses were found, NARS finalized all documents required to move forward with
notice to affected individuals and businesses, including you.
