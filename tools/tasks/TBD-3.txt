Blackbaud reported that, in May 2020, it experienced a ransomware incident that resulted in encryption of certain Blackbaud systems. Blackbaud reported the incident to law enforcement and worked with forensic investigators to determine the nature and scope of the incident. Following its investigation, Blackbaud notified its customers that an unknown actor may have accessed or acquired certain Blackbaud customer data. Blackbaud reported that the data was exfiltrated by the threat actor at some point before Blackbaud locked the threat actor out of the environment on May 20, 2020. Upon learning of the Blackbaud incident, Enloe immediately commenced an investigation to determine what, if any, sensitive Enloe data was potentially involved. This investigation included working diligently to gather further information from Blackbaud to understand the scope of the incident. The Blackbaud event affected thousands of organizations across many different states and countries. Although not the target of the ransomware incident, Enloe was one of the countless organizations that were impacted.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
On July 16, 2020, the Foundation was notified by its third-party provider, Blackbaud, of a security incident which involved your personal information. Blackbaud notified us that it discovered a ransomware attack on its systems around May 20, 2020. Blackbaud retained independent forensics experts and notified law enforcement. Shortly after the discovery, Blackbaud expelled the cybercriminal from its system.  However, Blackbaud determined that before being locked out the cybercriminal had removed a copy of the Foundation’s backup file maintained on Blackbaud’s servers, which contained your personal information. Blackbaud believes the cybercriminal accessed this file initially on February 7, 2020 and retained access until May 20, 2020. We understand that Blackbaud confirmed that the backup file copy had been destroyed. Based on the nature of the incident, Blackbaud’s research, and third-party (including law enforcement) investigations, Blackbaud does not believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was misused, or will be further disseminated.

On July 16, 2020, ECS was notified by Blackbaud, Inc., one of our third-party service providers, of a security incident. At this time, we understand Blackbaud discovered and stopped a ransomware attack.  After discovering the attack, the service provider’s cyber security team—together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement—successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking their system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from their system.

But before locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a backup file containing some constituent information. This occurred at some point beginning on February 7, 2020 and could have been in there intermittently until May 20, 2020.

The District uses the Aeries Student Information System to provide students and their parents with online access to information regarding school events and schedules. In late November 2019, Aeries learned that an unauthorized individual attempted to exploit a vulnerability in the Aeries software that would allow access to student and parent information. Aeries later determined that the exploit was successful. Upon discovery, Aeries began an investigation and law enforcement launched an investigation to identify the person responsible, who Aeries believes is now in police custody. On April, 2020, we learned that this individual may have accessed the District's Aeries System. We then conducted our own investigation, and on May 6, 2020, determined that the individual did access parent and student data in the District's Aeries System.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We recently learned that, earlier this year, a vendor we hired to perform due diligence services on
some of our loans, experienced a ransomware attack on its systems. Because the incident left the
vendor’s system inaccessible to the vendor, the vendor does not know all details of the incident or
the information affected.

On Sunday, June 28, 2020 Central European Time, we discovered a data breach incident involving malware and related behaviors that involved unauthorized access to our IT systems by an unknown third party. Under our current assessment, the unauthorized access to the files relevant to this notice began on June 21, 2020.<br><br>

Given the nature of the attack, we do not yet have a complete understanding of the scope of the unauthorized access to our data. We do, however, have reason to believe that such unauthorized access encompassed access to or loss of certain personal data stored on our IT systems.

Our technical team recently discovered that an unauthorized third party inserted malicious code on portions of our website that may have enabled them to capture certain information in connection with customer sign ups.  Based on our forensic investigation, this incident concerns the new member sign up pages of our website during the period between April 26, 2020 and May 14, 2020, and between May 22, 2020 and August 3, 2020. According to our records, you signed up for FabFitFun during this timeframe, and your information therefore could have been affected. Although we believe that only a subset of members who signed up during this period were affected, we are notifying everyone that signed up during this timeframe as a precaution.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In late February 2020, Filtersfast was made aware of a possible data security incident affecting its ecommerce website. Filtersfast immediately began investigating the potential issue. The investigation included hiring an outside expert forensics firm to analyze the Filtersfast systems and determine if there was a breach of security. On July 20, 2020, that investigation revealed that attackers had succeeded in adding malicious code to the Filtersfast website on July 15, 2019, which allowed unauthorized individuals to capture certain information during the checkout process. The malicious code was removed on July 10, 2020, during an unrelated update of the website, ending the unauthorized access. The information potentially affected includes customer name, shipping and billing address, and payment card information used to make a purchase on the e-commerce site.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In late July 2020, FMC was made aware of an issue involving a misconfiguration on one of its servers through a communication from a third-party security company unaffiliated with FMC. FMC immediately commenced an investigation and began working with third party computer specialists to determine the nature and scope of the issue. FMC also immediately addressed the misconfiguration and took steps to secure the server. A third party security company verified that the server security change resolved the issue. Through the investigation, FMC determined that a misconfiguration existed from approximately December 16, 2015 to July 31, 2020 that allowed external individual(s) access to the server.  On November 5, 2020, following an extensive review of forensic evidence associated with the server, FMC’s investigation determined that it could not conclusively rule out unauthorized access to records present on the server during the window of time when the misconfiguration was in place.

On November 18, 2020, Grass Valley USA, LLC and its worldwide affiliates (“Grass Valley”) were made aware of a data security incident affecting its former owners, the Belden group. Grass Valley was owned by Belden until July 2020. Belden continues to provide IT, HR and other services for Grass Valley pursuant to the terms of Grass Valley’s divestiture. On the evening of November 12, 2020, Belden IT professionals detected unusual activity involving certain company servers. Belden has reported to Grass Valley that upon detection of this activity, Belden immediately triggered its cybersecurity incident response plan, deployed teams of internal IT specialists, and engaged leading third-party cybersecurity forensic experts and other advisors to identify the scope of the incident and move quickly to mitigate the impact. According to Belden, forensics experts determined that Belden was the target of a sophisticated attack by a party outside the company. We understand that Belden learned on or about November 15, 2020 that the outside party accessed servers that contained, among other things, personal information of various individuals.  Belden informed Grass Valley upon becoming aware that Grass Valley’s current and some former employees were affected by the incident.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
On September 23, 2020, GGRC detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity’s network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity’s files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity’s files. Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. Based on preliminary findings of the computer forensics firm, it was determined on October 5, 2020, that certain information belonging to the individuals we serve was acquired by an unknown actor.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
On November 4, 2019, Good Sam became aware of a potential compromise to several of its email accounts as a result of a targeted email phishing campaign that occurred over several days. During the course of this phishing campaign, Good Sam employees began receiving fraudulent emails that appeared to be from a known contact. These fraudulent emails contained a link to a malicious website that was designed to steal email account credentials. Upon discovery, Good Sam swiftly blocked access to the malicious website. Additionally, Good Sam immediately took steps to secure the affected accounts, which included resetting the passwords required to access the affected employee email accounts and implementing additional email and network security measures. Further, Good Sam promptly began investigating the incident with the support of a third-party expert forensics firm. Following progress by experts in their thorough investigation, it was ultimately determined that several employee email accounts experienced unauthorized access between October 28, 2019 and November 8, 2019 as a result of the above-referenced phishing campaign.

On September 29, 2020, Hutchison School received notification from Blackbaud that cybercriminals rem
oved data from Blackbaud's computer system for the purpose of extorting funds from Blackbaud, one of
 the world's largest cloud providers of education administration, fundraising, and financial managem

We are contacting you regarding this incident with Blackbaud because some of your personal information may have been disclosed. On July 16, 2020, Blackbaud sent an email to HA stating that it had discovered a security incident in May of 2020. Blackbaud determined that an unauthorized third party had removed a copy of certain non-financial data, including data from HA and other Blackbaud clients, at some point between February 7, 2020 and May 20, 2020. Although Blackbaud told us that it believes the data was destroyed after Blackbaud made a payment in response to a demand from the unauthorized third party, we cannot independently confirm the destruction of the data.

On November 19, 2020, II-VI discovered a security incident involving unauthorized access to a II-VI employee email account from which a phishing email was sent that included a link to a page where recipients were requested to enter their II-VI account credentials. While II-VI promptly detected and blocked access to the link from its network, a limited number of recipients responded to the phishing email before II-VI blocked the fraudulent link, which may have exposed their credentials to the bad actor. This incident may have resulted in unauthorized access to certain data and file.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
On August 6, 2020, ICCD became aware of a potential compromise on our computer network. Upon discovery, ICCD swiftly engaged a third-party forensic company to investigate and we dedicated all of our IT and engineering resources to resolve the problem. Following progress by experts in their thorough investigation, it was ultimately determined that, on August 5, 2020, the administrative account of one employee was hacked and compromised by an unknown source, which allowed unauthorized access onto ICCD’s computer network. Upon confirmation of this unauthorized access, ICCD’s third-party forensic experts immediately investigated whether the affected databases contained individuals’ sensitive information. On October 16, 2020, after a thorough investigation, ICCD learned that the unauthorized access may have enabled access to individuals’ personal information. We diligently began reviewing the list to identify any records that contained information that was considered personally identifiable information (“PII”) under state and federal laws and to obtain sufficient contact information to provide you with this notification
