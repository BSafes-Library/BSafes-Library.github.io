Findings show that malware was installed on servers that processed payment cards used at restaurants and bars of 12 IHG managed properties. Cards used at the front desk of these properties were not affected. The malware searched for track data (cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through the affected server.

On October 27, 2017, the University Privacy Office (“UPO”) received a report that several folders with
confidential information on a shared file server maintained by the Graduate School of Business (“GSB”) were
accessible to GSB faculty, staff and students. The permissions on these folders were incorrectly changed around
September 2016, and thus the included files were viewable by the GSB community. The GSB IT team became
aware of the incorrect folder permissions on February 23, 2017. They adequately locked down the impacted
folders by March 3rd. However, because GSB did not appreciate the scope of the exposure there was a delay in
informing the UPO. Following notification, the UPO undertook a comprehensive review of all the files accessible
to the GSB community, and last week discovered a file with employee personal information. We do not have any
direct evidence that the file containing your personal information was actually accessed, downloaded or used by
any unauthorized person. However, out of an abundance of caution, we believe that it is important that we notify
you so that you can take steps to protect yourself.

On October 27, 2017, the University Privacy Office (“UPO”) received a report that several folders with
confidential information on a shared file server maintained by the Graduate School of Business (“GSB”) were
accessible to GSB faculty, staff and students. The GSB IT team became aware of the incorrect folder permissions
on February 23, 2017, however, because GSB did not appreciate the scope of the exposure there was a delay in
informing the UPO. Following notification, the UPO engaged a third-party forensics team and undertook a
comprehensive review of all the files accessible to the GSB community, and last week discovered a folder with
traveler personal information. The information was collected from students, faculty and staff who were traveling
internationally so that the GSB could provide support for travelers, in particular in the event of medical or other
emergency. Around 2014, there was an organizational change within the GSB traveler program and we believe
that it was during that transition that the folder with personal information of previous travelers was moved to the
shared drive. We do not have any direct evidence that the file containing your personal information was actually
accessed, downloaded or used by any unauthorized person. However, out of an abundance of caution, we believe
that it is important that we notify you so that you can take steps to protect yourself.

On May 10, 2020, The Chronicle concluded our investigation and analysis of a data security
incident that involved unauthorized access to one of our servers. The Chronicle learned about the incident after
receiving an internal alert about suspicious activity on the server. Upon learning of this, The Chronicle took the server
offline, a leading cyber security firm was engaged to assist with the investigation, and law enforcement was notified.
Through our investigation, The Chronicle determined that unauthorized parties exploited a vulnerability in the server,
through which they were able to obtain administrative account credentials for the server. The unauthorized parties then
logged in to the server on February 17, 2020 and accessed a database on the server that contained credentials for online
accounts to chronicle.com, philanthropy.com, and chroniclevitae.com.

 On or about March 28, 2018, we at The Affiliated Group (“TAG”), confirmed that an earlier
phishing email incident in November 2017 involving TAG resulted in unauthorized access to one TAG employee
email account. Upon learning of the phishing email incident, we immediately disabled the account and reset all
account passwords. Thereafter, we worked with third-party forensic investigators to determine what happened and
whether sensitive information may have been accessible. With the assistance of the investigators, we learned that an
unauthorized person gained access to the one TAG employee email account. Unfortunately, the investigation was
unable to determine which emails, if any, were specifically accessed as a result of this incident. The only confirmed
unauthorized activity identified was the use of the account to send phishing emails in an attempt to obtain user
credentials. Since the investigation was unable to rule out access to any specific email or attachment, we undertook
a programmatic and manual review of the contents of the account.
