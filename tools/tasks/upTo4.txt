On behalf of the 7-Eleven franchisees, 7-Eleven maintains a database of records for each franchise location that contains information on all franchisee employees for that location. Only the records in the database for the employees of a particular franchisee (“Employing Franchisee”) are sent to the local store and are available for access by the Employing Franchisee. 7-Eleven discovered in June 2016 that as part of the update process, in addition to the normal set of employee records sent for each Employing Franchisee, some additional records from the franchisee employee database were available to certain 7-Eleven franchisees. We immediately updated the records, investigated to determine the cause of the issue, and have taken additional safety measures to protect your information and ensure that records are not accidentally made available to any franchisee other than the Employing Franchisee.

Angelica did not learn about the inadvertent disclosure of the W-2s until April 15, 2018. Angelica immediately reached out to the former employee, who confirmed that he had deleted the message containing the W-2s. Prior to deleting the message, the former employee forwarded the attachment with all of the W-2s to his tax preparer and a current employee of Angelica, both of whom have confirmed that they deleted the file and that they did not forward the file to anyone else.

On or about November 9, 2018, we were alerted to suspicious activity regarding an employee’s business e-mail
account. We immediately began investigating this activity and subsequently determined that an unauthorized third
party had illegally gained access to the employee’s business e-mail account on July 21, 2018. The hacker also gained
access to a second employee’s email account. The hacker was able to view the contents of both e-mail accounts and
send “spear-phishing” e-mails to others. A “spear-phishing” e-mail is a message that appears to be from someone the
recipient knows and trusts, but it is actually sent by a different person trying to illegally obtain access to the recipient’s
computer system, e-mail accounts, or personal information. We have seen no evidence of this hack extending outside
of our email servers into the rest of our IT system.

Wendy’s recently reported additional malicious cyber activity involving some franchisee-operated
restaurants. The Company believes this criminal cyberattack resulted from a service provider’s remote
access credentials being compromised, allowing access – and the ability to deploy malware – to some
franchisees’ POS systems. Soon after detecting the malware, Wendy’s identified a method of disabling
it and thereafter has disabled the malware in all franchisee restaurants where it has been discovered. The
investigation has confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on
some Wendy’s franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015.

On Oct 24, 2014, we discovered that a third party obtained access to our users’ emails and
“hashed’ passwords. That means that the passwords were encrypted in such a way that it is nearly impossible
for anyone, even us, to read it. However, on Oct 24, 2017, a security researcher informed us of a file containing
emails and plaintext passwords which claims the data had come from us (Armor Games) and another company
(Coupon Mom). We are investigating whether we are the true source of the breach, since the number of leaked
emails/passwords is far less than the number of emails breached on either our system or Coupon Mom’s
system in 2013. Our users’ passwords were hashed (this makes it unlikely that they could extract plaintext
passwords from our data), and some users are reporting that their passwords were included in this breach
though they have never used either site. As we investigate the source of the data in this file, we are taking the
precautionary measure of treating this as a data breach of our own users.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Around March 21, 2013 we were notified by the credit card processing vendor that Anasazi was identified as the “common point of purchase” for a number of credit cards involved in fraudulent transactions with other merchants. The notice of common point of purchase was simply to alert Anasazi that it, perhaps with other merchants, was a merchant common to subsequent suspected fraudulent uses of payment cards used at our facility. In response to the notice, we quickly locked down our computer network and all computer systems and engaged forensic investigators, who analyzed all aspects of our data systems to determine whether credit card information was in fact accessed without authorization. The forensic experts uncovered evidence that Anasazi was the target of cyberattackers seeking to access parts of our internal network and data systems. The forensic experts found evidence that as early as June 18, 2012 the cyber-attackers installed malware apparently designed to perform certain functions, including eventually transmitting credit card data outside the secure network. While the forensic experts found no actual evidence that credit card information was in fact transmitted to the attackers, the forensic experts have concluded that the malware discovered on the Anasazi systems is consistent with that typically used to gather and transmit sensitive credit card data. Out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this notice to you even in the absence of hard evidence that your credit card data was in fact taken by the attackers.

As part of an ongoing investigation, we determined that your account was accessed without authorization in violation of AT&T’s privacy and security policies between February and July, 2014. AT&T believes your account was accessed as part of an effort to request codes that allow phones programmed for the AT&T Network to be used on other networks. This activity did not affect your AT&T mobile device(s). While there is no evidence that your Social Security Number or information related to telecommunications services that you purchase from AT&T, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information or CPNI (e.g., type of service or quantity of service), has been acquired, such information was contained in the system accessed and thus AT&T is offering you one year of free credit-monitoring. This notification to you has not been delayed as a result of a law enforcement investigation.

Despite having implemented industry-leading cyber defense protections, a cyber attacker was able to penetrate some of our systems. We discovered the unauthorized intrusion when AECOM’s security sensors notified us of suspicious behavior on the corporate network last month; and our investigation further determined last week that the attack impacted servers that contain employee payroll databases. This intrusion may have resulted in the exposure of personal information for present and past AECOM employees, including information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and personal bank account numbers and routing information. The records at issue covered only employees who are on, or have been on, U.S. payroll.

actors accessed certain employees’ accounts without authorization between August 3, 2018 and October 20, 2018.
Unfortunately, the investigation was unable to determine which emails or attachments may have been viewed without
authorization. In an abundance of caution, the entire contents of the email accounts involved were reviewed to identify
any personal information contained within the accounts. On December 19, 2018, the programmatic and manual review
was completed, and it was determined that certain personal information was contained within the accounts that were
accessed without authorization. To date, we have no information that there has been any actual or attempted misuse of
the personal information within the accounts related to this event.

On June 21, 2018, we discovered that someone (the “attacker”) had accessed two BioMarin email mailboxes,
beginning on June 18, 2018, as a result of a successful phishing attack by which the attacker acquired a temporary
employee’s user ID and password. When we discovered the breach on June 21, we had the temporary employee
change his credentials, thereby preventing further access to the mailboxes. We have so far been unable to
determine for certain whether the attacker extracted any or all of the information in the mailboxes before this
access was terminated, but it is possible.

This incident involved email threads which were used to entice recipients to open an attachment containing malware. Malware is a term used to describe any kind of computer software with malicious intent. Recipients of these malicious emails opened the attachments, believing them to be from a credible source, which in turn installed the malware. Unfortunately, this malware is very difficult to detect, and almost none of the virus scanners available out there today are able to do so. In total, we identified 23 infected computers across our organization. Regrettably, some of your personal information may have been contained within these infected computers as many of the emails were internal and therefore deemed to be secure. If you are an entity client, this may include your authorized persons’ personal information. It is important to note that we have no evidence to support any attempts to misuse private client information thus far, but there is a possibility that your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information may have been potentially exposed to others. We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. As such, we are providing you with complimentary credit monitoring for the next two years and we ask that you enroll by following the steps outline below.

Based upon an extensive forensic investigation, it appears that unauthorized individuals installed malicious software on our payment processing systems at certain restaurant locations designed to capture payment card information. These locations included 20 in California: Bakersfield, Burlingame, Campbell, Citrus Heights, Concord, Cupertino, Daly City, Downey, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Fresno, Hayward, La Mirada, Lakewood, Montclair, Sacramento, San Marcos, Torrance and West Covina; three in Colorado: Colorado Springs, Lakewood and Greenwood Village; two in Arizona: Chandler and Peoria, and one each in Orlando, Florida, St. Louis, Missouri, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Henderson, Nevada. We believe the malware could have compromised payment card data – including name, payment card account number, card expiration date, and verification code – of customers who used a payment card at the affected locations. Although the timing of the incident varies by location, the forensic investigation has indicated that this incident may have impacted individuals who made payment card purchases between August 12, 2015 and December 4, 2015. Please visit www.elephantbar.com/incident for a list of the affected locations, the specific time frame for each location during which we believe payment card data could have been affected, and some other helpful resources.

While this matter is still under investigation, we wish to report what we currently know. In early
March of 2016, we received notice from several of our restaurant locations that their Point of
Sale (POS) systems were not working properly. Our POS Vendor began an investigation to
assess the problem and initiated heightened security measures. When the POS Vendor found
malware on the POS software at some Cicis restaurants, we immediately began a restaurant by
restaurant data security review and remediation. We also retained a third party cyber security
firm to perform a forensic analysis to determine what, if any, information might have been
compromised and to verify that all threats have been eliminated. The forensic firm reported its
findings on July 19, 2016 confirming that a malicious software program had been introduced by
a hacker to the POS system used by some Cicis restaurant locations. The threat of that malware
to our restaurants has been eliminated

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Choice recently learned of a technical issue that only occurred in a specific circumstance. The cause of
the issue has been addressed. The issue involved information entered by a visitor to Choice’s website
being inadvertently accessible to third parties, with whom Choice has a business relationship, when the
visitor’s web browser crashed while on the site. Choice uses technology to track activities that occur on
its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to Choice.
For visitors to Choice’s website who used the Safari web browser, if Safari crashed and restarted, Safari
would put information that had been typed by the visitor on the page into the website address for that
page. Tracking technology reads the website address of pages on Choice’s website and sends the data
to third parties. Except in a Safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information
entered by visitors. We believe this occurred because of how the code for Safari was written. This
specific issue occurred approximately 88,000 times from June 2015 through November 12, 2019.

from our third party e-commerce partner. We immediately began to investigate these reports to
identify what happened and what information was impacted. Third-party computer forensic
investigators were retained to assist with the investigation into what happened and what data was

Between March 31, 2020 and April 1, 2020, four (4) electronically filed tax returns were rejected by the Intuit Lacerte tax preparation software, which Lacerte reported was due to the fact that returns were previously filed for those taxpayers.  We immediately reported this incident to the IRS, Secret Service, Fresno Police and FBI, and, working with Lacerte, identified a total of 30 fraudulent returns. You are not among the individuals identified on the 30 fraudulent returns.  We also immediately retained forensic investigators to conduct an investigation, and, to date, we have found no evidence that any unauthorized individual has accessed our computer systems, where your personal information is stored.

For most hotels, there are two ways to make a reservation – directly with the hotel or indirectly through
third-party online booking websites (websites run by other companies that compare rooms and rates at
different hotels). For reservations that are made through online booking websites, many hotels use a
technology service provider to collect the reservation data from the online booking company and enter it
into the hotel’s property management system. On March 26, 2019, we were notified by the company that
provides that service to us and other hotel companies that it was conducting an investigation to determine
if there had been unauthorized access to its network. The service provider reported that it had hired a
cybersecurity firm to conduct an investigation. Since then Drury Hotels has worked closely with the service
provider to get updates on its investigation.

On October 31, 2018, we learned from one of our security vendors that a third-party may have attempted
to log in to your DD Perks account. We believe that these third-parties obtained usernames and
passwords from security breaches of other companies. These individuals then used the usernames and
passwords to try to break in to various online accounts across the Internet. Our security vendor was
successful in stopping most of these attempts, but it is possible that these third-parties may have
succeeded in logging in to your DD Perks account if you used your DD Perks username and password for

On January 30, 2016, we discovered spam files on one of our data servers. We removed the
spam and immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature of the access and what data may have
been stored on that server. We also hired a third party forensic investigator to supplement our investigation. The
forensic investigation revealed that the spam spread to a second domain on the same server. That server contained
a file with your information which you provided to Empathia when you submitted a request for a credit check in
2003 or 2004. We have no evidence that your data was accessed by an unauthorized individual, and we are
not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information. What’s more, there is no indication the
unauthorized access was for any purpose other than using our servers to spread spam emails. However, we
are providing this notice to you out of an abundance of caution.

On August 21, 2017, files on Far Niente’s computers were encrypted by an individual who gained unauthorized
access to Far Niente’s computer network. The individual demanded a ransom in exchange for restoring access to the
encrypted files. We immediately began an investigation and retained a leading computer forensic firm to help us.
The forensic firm determined on August 21, 2017, that the unauthorized person may have had access to our computer
network for several hours before encrypting our computer files. We terminated the unauthorized access and restored
the encrypted files with unaffected back-up files. We did not pay the ransom demanded by the individual.

On September 23, 2020, GGRC detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity’s network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity’s files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity’s files. Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. Based on preliminary findings of the computer forensics firm, it was determined on October 5, 2020, that certain information belonging to the individuals we serve was acquired by an unknown actor.

On Monday, June 17, 2013, there was a burglary at our offices at 2039 Forest Avenue. It appears the burglars entered the building complex through an unlocked door and then entered our office space by accessing the crawl space above our office. They did not break through any locked doors or windows. Among the items stolen were two laptops. One of the stolen laptops was used only to access the internet and did not have any patient information on it. However, the other laptop, which was password protected, contained all patient names, dates of birth, and significant medical records including visit dates, complaints, physical examinations, diagnoses, testing and medication information. The burglary was reported to the San Jose Police Department, Report No. 13-168-0169.

? Inogen learned on March 14, 2018 that messages within an email account belonging to an Inogen
employee may have been accessed without authorization and that some of those messages may have contained some of
your family member’s personal information. As soon as we discovered this incident, we took steps to secure your family
member’s personal information. We also required all email users to change their passwords and implemented multi-factor
authentication for remote email access. Finally, we launched an investigation and engaged a leading forensics firm to
determine what happened and whether customer information contained within the email account had been accessed or
acquired without authorization. While we have no evidence that your family member’s information has been misused, out
of an abundance of caution, we are informing you of the incident and providing you with the resources described in this

On the late afternoon of Monday July 25, 2016, my car window was broken out and my briefcase was stolen. In that briefcase was an external hard drive containing two different types of data. First, all office patient records were backed up on the drive, including social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, phone numbers, date of birth, physical and email addresses and health insurance information. NO passwords or user names appear in these records. No complete credit card information or bank account information was stored on this drive (only the last four digits of the most recent card used is stored). As a result, your personal information is now potentially accessible to unauthorized individuals. However, the risk of accessibility is extremely low because the data in its format is unreadable. In consulting with my dental soft-ware experts, they assure me it would be incredibly difficult and unlikely for anyone to access your records. However, since the data is not encrypted, I am required by law to notify you.  Secondly, pictures of patient cases (teeth only, no faces) that included patient first and last names and phone numbers were saved on the drive. These files of pictures are stored in jpeg format and can be opened easily.

result of the investigation, on or around June 14, 2019, KPRS confirmed that an unknown person may have gained access
to the email account. We then hired computer forensics experts to assist us with the investigation to help us determine
whether any individuals’ personal information may have been affected. Based on the results of the investigation, it was
determined that the unknown individual may have had unauthorized access to certain employees’ email accounts during
March and April 2019, and individuals’ personal information stored in the accounts may have been affected.

the Hotel was being operated by a prior owner. Using malware, the intruder was able to gain
access to and view guest reservation information. The malware was quickly removed and the

On August 23, 2016, we discovered that our payment card processing system may have been accessed without our
authorization. We immediately launched a full investigation, including working with a third-party digital forensic
investigator. We determined that the unauthorized access occurred intermittently between August 11 and August
16, 2016, and only affected customers entering a payment card new to our system. Our records indicate you made a
purchase with us using a new card during this time. While not all cards used during this time period were necessarily
affected, out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of this incident.

potential cybersecurity incident. We promptly undertook an investigation, with the assistance of outside
forensic experts. The investigation determined that, on May 6, 2020, unauthorized actors obtained
information from our user account database. Since determining this on May 15, we have been
continuing to investigate as expeditiously as possible to assess what information was impacted and to
identify and notify affected users.

On June 19, 2020, MCCKC determined that your information may have been available to an unauthorized party due to a ransomware attack that resulted in certain data being encrypted. Following the incident, MCCKC immediately engaged a third party to conduct a forensic investigation with the objective of identifying the potential scope of access the threat actor may have had to the environment during the period of unauthorized access, which included arriving at a determination as to whether sensitive personal data was accessed by an unauthorized third party. The forensic investigation was recently completed and determined that an unauthorized individual may have had access to the MCCKC environment. The forensic investigation did not conclude or preclude that data was extracted from MCCKC’s systems however, it is possible that certain personal data, including names, Social Security numbers, drivers’ license information and medical information of former, prospective, and current students could have been accessed by an unauthorized party.  The investigation further acknowledged that the names, Social Security numbers and bank account information of employees could have been accessible as well, however, there is no evidence that any personal information was extracted from MCC’s systems or subject to actual or attempted misuse. Although the investigation did not find any specific access to any individual’s information and MCCKC has no indication that data has been extracted from MCCKC’s systems or misused, we have chosen to notify all potentially impacted parties of this incident out of an abundance of caution and in full transparency.

Through these investigations, PaperlessPay confirmed that an unknown person (the “Hacker”)
on February 18, 2020accessed PaperlessPay’s database where MMC employees’ data was
stored. The available evidence has not, however, allowed DHS, the FBI, or Ankura to
determine what data the Hacker may have accessed or viewed while connected to the database.
It is possible the Hacker only used access to determine the size of the database and to stage it
for subsequent access that could be sold to others, and that the Hacker did not directly access
any employee data. The security system also has an alert system that is configured to detect
data file transfers that exceed 1GB in size, and no alert was triggered during this security
incident event. However, the Hacker would have had the capability to run queries against the
database and view its data, so we cannot rule out the possibility of unauthorized access or
acquisition.

On April 27, 2017, when parents tried to access their student’s data through the HomeLink Portal, they were able to
view information, as described below, of a student other than their own. The period of time parents and students had
inadvertent exposure to another student’s information was one hour—between 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. and the data of
approximately 600 families was exposed. The District has no reason to believe that any personally identifiable student
information was accessed by an unauthorized person; however, it was possible during this brief window. Once the District
learned of the problem, we immediately took HomeLink offline and began working with our Student Information System
provider (“Eagle Soft”) and with Microsoft. Eagle Soft and Microsoft have identified the malfunction as a caching problem that
has now been repaired. Please note that the District is operating HomeLink as intended by Eagle Soft and Microsoft. The error
occurred due to a software malfunction that was outside of the District’s control.

We were unfortunately the victims of a social engineering scam that allowed an unauthorized party or
parties to access one of our employee’s email accounts and other portions of our network in November
2018. Although our IT support responded immediately by shutting down access to the account, replacing
our entire server and implementing additional security measures, a recent forensic investigation found that
our system was likely compromised. No evidence was found that files from our system were extracted in
the incident. Due to the high percentage of e-file rejections in the tax season, we have engaged a third
party and outside IT and information security consultant to further investigate, evaluate and respond to the
situation. Although data breaches have been commonplace even in the most secure environments, we

directed to a website that gave a phone number to call for immediate assistance. When I called this number, the
technician stated he could certainly help. He requested access to my computer to understand the issue with the
email. After I installed the software necessary to give him remote access to my computer, he pulled up some IP
addresses on my computer screen and stated that this was the reason for the email failure. He then insisted that in
order to fix the problem and prevent viruses from attacking, I would need to allow him to install a program on our
office’s network server. I told him no and that our local computer technician would be contacted to deal with this.
At that point, he stated that only a Microsoft Tech such as himself would be able to do this. This was a red flag as I

On or about May 11, 2018, MedEvolve discovered that an FTP containing a file with information
related to certain Premier patients was inadvertently accessible to the internet. Upon discovery, MedEvolve launched
an investigation, with the help of third-party forensic investigators, to determine the contents of the file, how long the
file was internet accessible, and whether the file was subject to unauthorized access. This investigation is ongoing.
However, the investigation determined that the file was internet accessible from March 29, 2018 to May 4, 2018.
The investigation also determined that the file was subject to unauthorized access on March 29, 2018. Additionally,
we learned that a screenshot of the internet accessible file was taken and posted online in an article regarding this
incident. The screenshot posted online contained the first names, city, state and ZIP Code of fifteen (15) patients, but
did not include patients’ last names or street addresses.

On July 24, 2019, we discovered that the login point for users on the Niche.com
website was subject to an automated attack. The attack attempted to gain
access to Niche user accounts using username and password pairs from
externally available sources. While our investigation found no evidence that
user account information was compromised or changed, there were successful
logins detected for certain Niche users from a source believed to be a part of
the attack. We promptly investigated the scope of the attack and disabled
potentially compromised passwords. Though we did not find any evidence that
any account information was collected from the users following the
unauthorized login, we locked user accounts and prompted users to reset
passwords out of an abundance of caution.

On May 6, 2019, Northwood became aware of suspicious activity relating to an employee email
account, as a result of a phishing email that captured the employee’s login credentials. We immediately launched an
investigation to determine what may have happened and what information may have been affected. Working together
with a leading computer forensics expert, our investigation determined that an unauthorized individual accessed the
email account between May 3 and May 6, 2019. Because we were unable to determine which email messages in the
account may have been accessed or viewed by the unauthorized individual, we reviewed the entire contents of the email
account to identify what personal and protected information was stored within it. On June 19, 2019, we identified the
individuals potentially impacted by this incident after a thorough review of the email account. No other email accounts or
Northwood systems were impacted by this incident.

Earlier this year NARS discovered suspicious emails being sent from an employee’s email
account. NARS quickly launched an investigation, with the assistance of a third party forensic investigator, to
understand the nature and scope of the event, and whether any sensitive data was at risk. The forensic investigation
confirmed that just a few employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized access from February 7, 2018 until
March 27, 2018 some of which were accessible for much less time. The forensic investigator then reviewed the email
accounts to determine if they contained any personal information. On June 27, 2018, NARS determined the affected
email accounts contained information relating to you. Unfortunately, the forensic investigator was only able to locate
a small percentage of the addresses for the individuals and entities whose information was stored within these emails.
NARS then undertook an extensive search of its internal records and a third-party vendor was retained to locate the
missing addresses. Once these addresses were found, NARS finalized all documents required to move forward with
notice to affected individuals and businesses, including you.
