On April 1, 2016, we received notice from our electronic medical record provider that
their electronic system was breached and some of our patient records were acquired
by unauthorized persons. Specifically, they determined that cyber intruders may have
installed malware in January 2015 and, through credential theft, accessed certain
systems in their environment. We immediately requested further information to
identify which of our patients were affected and on April 22, 2016, we were informed
that such information could not be confirmed with a high level of confidence. Though
we do not have confirmation that your records were compromised, given the
sensitivity of the information potentially exposed we wanted to notify you of this
matter as soon as possible as your patient records were on the affected electronic
medical record system.

These temporary data files are used only to complete e-commerce transactions and are not otherwise retained by Bellacor.

it was injected by the unauthorized third party around June 7th. While our investigation is ongoing, we believe that in
certain limited circumstances the unauthorized third party was able to extract such information from the temporary data

information about our customers. While we do not have evidence that your information was compromised, we are taking
precautionary measures to protect your financial security and alleviate concerns you may have.

We are contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred on August 25, 2020 at Cantella & Co., Inc. This incident involved email threads which were used to entice recipients to open an attachment containing malware. Malware is a term used to describe any kind of computer software with malicious intent. Recipients of these malicious emails opened the attachments, believing them to be from a credible source, which in turn installed the malware. Unfortunately, this malware is very difficult to detect, and almost none of the virus scanners available out there today are able to do so. In total, we identified 23 infected computers across our organization. Regrettably, some of your personal information may have been contained within these infected computers as many of the emails were internal and therefore deemed to be secure. If you are an entity client, this may include your authorized persons’ personal information. It is important to note that we have no evidence to support any attempts to misuse private client information thus far, but there is a possibility that your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information may have been potentially exposed to others. We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. As such, we are providing you with complimentary credit monitoring for the next two years and we ask that you enroll by following the steps outline below.

up paying the attacker and recovering all of our data. We do not have any evidence that the attacker or anyone else has
misused any of the data subject to the attack. However, we do know that an unauthorized person or persons had access to
the data for a short period of time. Therefore, we are notifying you of the incident.

On Friday January 19, 2018, a California College of Arts (the “College”) laptop used
by one of our employees was stolen out of the employee’s vehicle. The employee promptly reported the
theft to College staff and to local law enforcement. The College quickly began to investigate and take
steps to respond. The user’s passwords were changed to prevent access to the College’s computer
systems. The College also began to monitor for signs that the laptop was active to remotely wipe the
device. To date, the College has not seen any signs that laptop has connected to the internet. Since
learning of the theft, the College has been identifying and reviewing files that may have been contained
on the laptop at the time of the theft to determine what information may have been accessible on the
device. To date, we have no evidence of any actual or attempted misuse of information as a result of this

On May 13, 2016, the County experienced a phishing email attack that affected approximately 108 out of 120,000 County
employee email accounts. A phishing email tries to trick someone into giving up important information (in this case,
email account usernames and passwords) by appearing to come from a trustworthy source. Email accounts are used
by County employees to communicate about and coordinate County services. As a recipient of County services,
information concerning you described below was identified in one or more of these email accounts and may have
been compromised. Due to the ongoing investigation by law enforcement, we were advised to delay notifying you of this
incident until now, as public notice may have hindered their investigation.

On February 24, 2016, we became aware of a data breach by which we believe a third party obtained access to
copies of your 2015 W-2 income and tax withholding statements. This information was stolen through a sophisticated

A Calpine employee’s laptop, which contained confidential employee information, was stolen from a car.
We learned from law enforcement that the car that was broken into is one of several cars broken into on
the same day, in the same general vicinity. We believe that the theft was likely conducted by someone
interested in the value of hardware stolen as opposed to information or files on the computer. In addition,
the computer was password protected and contained software that would cause the computer to be
immediately wiped if the unauthorized user connected to the Internet. Also, the financial information on
the laptop was maintained in a format that would make it difficult for a bad actor to exploit.

Wendy’s recently reported additional malicious cyber activity involving some franchisee-operated
restaurants. The Company believes this criminal cyberattack resulted from a service provider’s remote
access credentials being compromised, allowing access – and the ability to deploy malware – to some
franchisees’ POS systems. Soon after detecting the malware, Wendy’s identified a method of disabling
it and thereafter has disabled the malware in all franchisee restaurants where it has been discovered. The
investigation has confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on
some Wendy’s franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015.

While this matter is still under investigation, we wish to report what we currently know. In early

malware on the POS software at some Cicis restaurants, we immediately began a restaurant by
restaurant data security review and remediation. We also retained a third party cyber security
firm to perform a forensic analysis to determine what, if any, information might have been
compromised and to verify that all threats have been eliminated. The forensic firm reported its
findings on July 19, 2016 confirming that a malicious software program had been introduced by
a hacker to the POS system used by some Cicis restaurant locations. The threat of that malware
to our restaurants has been eliminated

Choice recently learned of a technical issue that only occurred in a specific circumstance. The cause of
the issue has been addressed. The issue involved information entered by a visitor to Choice’s website
being inadvertently accessible to third parties, with whom Choice has a business relationship, when the
visitor’s web browser crashed while on the site. Choice uses technology to track activities that occur on
its website (e.g., cookies), and that technology sends data to companies that provide services to Choice.
For visitors to Choice’s website who used the Safari web browser, if Safari crashed and restarted, Safari
would put information that had been typed by the visitor on the page into the website address for that
page. Tracking technology reads the website address of pages on Choice’s website and sends the data
to third parties. Except in a Safari crash circumstance, the page address does not contain information
entered by visitors. We believe this occurred because of how the code for Safari was written. This
specific issue occurred approximately 88,000 times from June 2015 through November 12, 2019.

On or around December 1, 2016, we received reports of suspicious activity
from our third party e-commerce partner. We immediately began to investigate these reports to
identify what happened and what information was impacted. Third-party computer forensic
investigators were retained to assist with the investigation into what happened and what data was
impacted. The investigation initially identified suspicious files on the system. In an abundance of
caution, all user passwords were reset as this incident was initially determined to impact only
name, address, email address, and encrypted passwords. Further investigation identified a
malicious code inserted into the e-commerce website. Upon identifying the malicious code,
Cuddl Duds and its partner quickly took steps to remove the code and prevent further
unauthorized access. A review of the code determined that it was capable of collecting
information provided by customers on the checkout page of Cuddl Duds.

We value and respect the privacy of information which is why Contra Costa Health Plan (CCHP) is writing to

The Contractor worked under a series of contracts with CCHP beginning on December 1, 2014 to perform services
related to utilization management. During the Contractor’s time with CCHP, the Contractor had access to certain
portions of your information. On May 22, 2018, CCHP was made aware that the Contractor had falsified her identity
to obtain a contract to provide services to CCHP. Immediately upon CCHP’s knowledge of the false identity and
related Department of Health Care Services investigation, CCHP terminated the contract with the Contractor, along
with her access to CCHP’s internal records. CCHP conducted a thorough forensic audit trail, and at the time of this
notice there is no current evidence of any improper access, use, or disclosure of your information by the Contractor.
Although we have no evidence of actual misuse of any of your information, we are notifying you due to the nature

We became aware of unauthorized posts on a public website which contained
confidential City information. We immediately began an investigation to identify the source of the activity
and to confirm the security of our network, and we worked with a third-party forensic investigator to
determine the nature and scope of this event. During our investigation, we discovered an internal data
storage account was accessed by unauthorized users on multiple occasions from about 2016 through June
21, 2019. The investigation further revealed the data included copies of emails and attachments that
contained certain protected information. As a precaution, the entire contents of the storage account was
reviewed to identify the information that may have been accessible within the account. We provided written
notice to those individuals whose information was found in the data storage account. However, a small
number of files that were present in the data storage account at the time of the access were not recovered

On April 5, 2016, CSUN officials learned that online records containing information relating to CSUN Educational

immediately began an investigation and discovered that an ID and password were mistakenly published on an

We take the security of our community very seriously. Earlier this month, we became aware of unusual
activity involving a third-party service provider. We immediately launched an investigation and an
outside security expert was engaged to assess what occurred. We were subsequently able to determine
that an unauthorized third party accessed some DoorDash user data on May 4, 2019. We took immediate
steps to block further access by the unauthorized third party and to enhance security across our platform.

Decron became aware of unusual activity in certain Decron email accounts. In
response, Decron worked with an outside forensics expert to investigate the nature and scope of the
activity. Through this investigation, Decron confirmed that certain email accounts were accessed
without authorization on April 28, 2019. Although the investigation was unable to determine whether
any information contained in email messages or file attachments stored in the email accounts was
actually accessed by an unauthorized actor, we cannot rule out whether that type of activity occurred.
In an abundance of caution, Decron performed a thorough review of the information contained within
the impacted email accounts, and on October 24, 2019, determined that your personal information was
potentially accessible by the unauthorized actor. Extra4 Variable Sentence- Tenant Language Extra4
