We were recently notified by one of our third-party service providers of a security incident. At this time, we understand they discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. After discovering the attack, the service provider’s Cyber Security team—together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement— successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking their system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from their system. Prior to locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of our backup file containing your personal information. This occurred at some point beginning on February 7, 2020 and could have been in there intermittently until May 20, 2020.

On November 6, 2020, through Merchant Services’* internal cybersecurity program, we discovered a potential compromise of a website used by part of our U.S. business. We promptly initiated an investigation to determine the nature and potential impact of the vulnerability. In the course of doing so, we identified suspicious activity indicating that an unauthorized actor submitted automated queries to the website. We created a secure environment to test the queries, using available logs and other information to assess potential impact. By November 19, 2020, we determined that a subset of the queries identified might have involved data held on the website. We analyzed logs and other information available to assess whether those queries could have returned information to unauthorized actors, and we engaged external forensics experts to assist. By December 3, 2020, we determined that some queries may have compromised certain information held on the website, although the evidence is not conclusive. At this time, we have identified evidence of suspicious activity on the website between May 13, 2018, and November 24, 2020. We have notified law enforcement.  Although we are not aware of any evidence confirming that the activity resulted in unauthorized actors acquiring or misusing your personal information, we are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution so that you can take steps to protect yourself.

After a recent upgrade to their backup systems, a configuration error exposed Schoolzilla’s backup files. A
computer security researcher doing targeted vulnerability analysis detected this issue late on April 4, 2017,
downloaded those files, and notified Schoolzilla of the problem. As soon as Schoolzilla received the notice
on the morning of April 5, 2017, they immediately fixed the error, verified via log files that nobody other than
the one security researcher accessed those exposed files, and ensured that the security researcher who
discovered and alerted us to this vulnerability permanently and securely deleted the data.

On May 10, 2012, in the course, of upgrading to a new imaging and management software called Eaglesoft to better serve you, a representative of one of our dental practice’s business partners, Patterson Dental, visited our offices and, without our knowledge or consent in violation of our policies and procedures in exporting your data for the new systems conversion process had placed an unencrypted USB memory chip containing data from our practice into a sealed envelope and deposited it at a local post office to be sent through the U.S. mail to their technical headquarters. On May 14, 2012, this envelope arrived at its destination with a tear on the side and without the USB memory chip. The representative and this business partner have searched and continue to search for this USB memory chip, but have not located it to date. They believe it is most likely that the memory chip was “squeezed out” of the envelope and the envelope torn when the letter was put through a processing machine at the post office. We were notified by Patterson Dental on May 18, 2012 of this occurrence.

We promptly notified law enforcement of the incident and engaged a leading external cybersecurity firm to assess the potential disclosure of protected health information.<br><br>

In a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. After discovering the attack, our cyber security team – in partnership with outside information technology and forensics experts – successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and ultimately expelled them from our system. As recommended, SVH did not pay ransom.
