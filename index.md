During the forensic analysis, 1919ic was able to quickly take steps to prevent further unauthorized access and secure our systems. At this time, we do not have any indication that your information was accessed or misused.

Atlas recently became aware of suspicious activity on its computer network and discovered it could not access certain files on its systems. Atlas immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of thirdparty computer forensic specialists, and determined that its network had been infected with malware which prevented access to certain files on the system. The investigation determined that the malware was introduced into the system by an unauthorized actor who also accessed and acquired certain files in Atlas’ system. Atlas then began a lengthy and labor-intensive process to identify sensitive information that may have been contained within impacted files, and to identify the individuals whose information may have been impacted. While our investigation is ongoing, we are notifying you because that investigation determined certain information related to you may have been impacted.

We recognize that it may feel like there was a delay between the initial incident and receiving this notification. From the moment we knew that files were accessible to the unknown actors, we have been working both internally to determine who could have been affected, as well as externally with appropriate authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate globally. Thank you for your understanding and patience while we worked through all the necessary details.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We are contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred on August 25, 2020 at Cantella & Co., Inc. This incident involved email threads which were used to entice recipients to open an attachment containing malware. Malware is a term used to describe any kind of computer software with malicious intent. Recipients of these malicious emails opened the attachments, believing them to be from a credible source, which in turn installed the malware. Unfortunately, this malware is very difficult to detect, and almost none of the virus scanners available out there today are able to do so. In total, we identified 23 infected computers across our organization. Regrettably, some of your personal information may have been contained within these infected computers as many of the emails were internal and therefore deemed to be secure. If you are an entity client, this may include your authorized persons’ personal information. It is important to note that we have no evidence to support any attempts to misuse private client information thus far, but there is a possibility that your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information may have been potentially exposed to others. We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. As such, we are providing you with complimentary credit monitoring for the next two years and we ask that you enroll by following the steps outline below.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
On September 23, 2020, GGRC detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity’s network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity’s files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity’s files. Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. Based on preliminary findings of the computer forensics firm, it was determined on October 5, 2020, that certain information belonging to the individuals we serve was acquired by an unknown actor.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We care about the security of your personal information, and we are writing to tell you that we have discovered evidence of unauthorized access to some of your personal information. On October 9, 2020, we were alerted to unusual activity involving our website, thenorthface.com, that prompted us to investigate immediately. Following a careful investigation, we concluded that a credential stuffing attack had been launched against our website on October 8 and 9, 2020. A “credential stuffing attack” is a specific type of cybersecurity attack in which the attacker uses account authentication credentials (e.g., email addresses/usernames and passwords) stolen from another source, such as a breach of another company or website, to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Credential stuffing attacks can occur when individuals use the same authentication credentials on multiple websites, which is why we encourage you to use a unique password on thenorthface.com.<br><br>  

Based on our investigation, we believe that the attacker previously gained access to your email address and password from another source (not from The North Face) and subsequently used those same credentials to access your account on thenorthface.com.<br><br>  

We do not believe that the attacker obtained information from us that would require us to notify you of a data security breach under applicable law, but we are notifying you of the incident voluntarily, out of an abundance of caution.<br><br>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
On April 27, 2020 Woodland was notified by Aeries Software, Inc. (“Aeries”), a third-party student data management vendor, of a potential data incident affecting Aeries’ school district clients. While Aeries indicated it found no evidence to suggest that any data was specifically accessed, that type of activity cannot be ruled out with certainty. Aeries also stated that local and federal law enforcement officials were notified of this incident.  The notification prompted Woodland to immediately launch an investigation into the nature and scope of the event.  The investigation determined that personal information residing in our Aeries Student Information System (“SIS”) was potentially subject to unauthorized access on or around November 4, 2019. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this information, we undertook a comprehensive review of our Aeries SIS to confirm the type of information it contained and to whom it related. This review was completed on September 15, 2020 and we determined certain information relating to you resided in our Aeries SIS in November 2019 and thus was potentially subject to unauthorized access.
