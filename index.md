  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Atlas recently became aware of suspicious activity on its computer network and discovered it could not access certain files on its systems. Atlas immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of thirdparty computer forensic specialists, and determined that its network had been infected with malware which prevented access to certain files on the system. The investigation determined that the malware was introduced into the system by an unauthorized actor who also accessed and acquired certain files in Atlas’ system. Atlas then began a lengthy and labor-intensive process to identify sensitive information that may have been contained within impacted files, and to identify the individuals whose information may have been impacted. While our investigation is ongoing, we are notifying you because that investigation determined certain information related to you may have been impacted.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
On October 2, 2020, Backroads became aware of suspicious activity within its computer network.  Backroads immediately began an investigation, working with external forensic specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the activity. Our investigation determined that certain files within our environment were encrypted and inaccessible. On October 16, 2020, we discovered that certain files had been accessible to unknown actors and that certain personal information was contained in these files. We recognize that it may feel like there was a delay between the initial incident and receiving this notification. From the moment we knew that files were accessible to the unknown actors, we have been working both internally to determine who could have been affected, as well as externally with appropriate authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate globally. Thank you for your understanding and patience while we worked through all the necessary details.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In late July 2020, FMC was made aware of an issue involving a misconfiguration on one of its servers through a communication from a third-party security company unaffiliated with FMC. FMC immediately commenced an investigation and began working with third party computer specialists to determine the nature and scope of the issue. FMC also immediately addressed the misconfiguration and took steps to secure the server. A third party security company verified that the server security change resolved the issue. Through the investigation, FMC determined that a misconfiguration existed from approximately December 16, 2015 to July 31, 2020 that allowed external individual(s) access to the server.  On November 5, 2020, following an extensive review of forensic evidence associated with the server, FMC’s investigation determined that it could not conclusively rule out unauthorized access to records present on the server during the window of time when the misconfiguration was in place.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
On September 23, 2020, GGRC detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity’s network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity’s files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity’s files. Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. Based on preliminary findings of the computer forensics firm, it was determined on October 5, 2020, that certain information belonging to the individuals we serve was acquired by an unknown actor.
