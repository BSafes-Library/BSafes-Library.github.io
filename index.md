  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We are contacting you regarding a data security incident that has occurred on August 25, 2020 at Cantella & Co., Inc. This incident involved email threads which were used to entice recipients to open an attachment containing malware. Malware is a term used to describe any kind of computer software with malicious intent. Recipients of these malicious emails opened the attachments, believing them to be from a credible source, which in turn installed the malware. Unfortunately, this malware is very difficult to detect, and almost none of the virus scanners available out there today are able to do so. In total, we identified 23 infected computers across our organization. Regrettably, some of your personal information may have been contained within these infected computers as many of the emails were internal and therefore deemed to be secure. If you are an entity client, this may include your authorized persons’ personal information. It is important to note that we have no evidence to support any attempts to misuse private client information thus far, but there is a possibility that your name, address, social security number, and other identifying information may have been potentially exposed to others. We value your business and respect the privacy of your information. As such, we are providing you with complimentary credit monitoring for the next two years and we ask that you enroll by following the steps outline below.

We care about the security of your personal information, and we are writing to tell you that we have discovered evidence of unauthorized access to some of your personal information. On October 9, 2020, we were alerted to unusual activity involving our website, thenorthface.com, that prompted us to investigate immediately. Following a careful investigation, we concluded that a credential stuffing attack had been launched against our website on October 8 and 9, 2020. A “credential stuffing attack” is a specific type of cybersecurity attack in which the attacker uses account authentication credentials (e.g., email addresses/usernames and passwords) stolen from another source, such as a breach of another company or website, to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Credential stuffing attacks can occur when individuals use the same authentication credentials on multiple websites, which is why we encourage you to use a unique password on thenorthface.com.<br><br>  

Based on our investigation, we believe that the attacker previously gained access to your email address and password from another source (not from The North Face) and subsequently used those same credentials to access your account on thenorthface.com.<br><br>
